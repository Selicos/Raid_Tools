# RAID Shadow Legends - Mastery System

## How Masteries Work

### Basic Rules
- **Tree Selection:** Each champion can use 2 of 3 mastery trees (Offense, Defense, Support)
- **Tiers:** Each tree has 6 tiers (T1 → T6)
- **Selection Limits:**
  - **T1:** Select 1 mastery per tree used (max 2 total)
  - **T2-T5:** Select up to 3 masteries total per tier (can be from either tree)
  - **T6:** Select 1 capstone mastery (from either tree)
- **Path Connection:** You can only select masteries connected to a mastery you selected in the previous tier (vertical branching paths)
- **Tier Unlock:** To unlock the next tier, you need at least 1 mastery selected in the current tier

### Obtaining Masteries
- **Farm:** Minotaur's Labyrinth dungeon (drops mastery scrolls)
- **Purchase:** 800 gems for instant full mastery unlock (all tiers)
- **Reset:** 
  - First reset: FREE (one-time only)
  - Subsequent resets: Small gem cost (150 gems)

### Important Notes
- ❌ No "point system" - masteries are selected directly, not purchased with points
- ✅ Warmaster/Giant Slayer do NOT require critical hits to proc
- ✅ All masteries apply to Clan Boss (no content restrictions)
- ⚠️ Some masteries break speed tunes (Rapid Response, Arcane Celerity, Whirlwind of Death, Spirit Haste, Oppressor)

Should only be taken on champions with guaranteed criticals or requires pure attack (e.g. Bomb Debuff champion). In late game with 100% Critical Rate equipment, this becomes more beneficial for damage dealers.                               |
| Deadly Precision        | +5% Critical Rate                                                                                                                                     | Commonly used by 99% of champions and benefits significantly for Attack role.

Great for champions with healing abilities or Lifesteal Set. Works well with Shield champions. Can boost Warmaster and Giant Slayer mastery damage.                                                                                                                          |

Extra damage only applies to shield, not HP. Does not benefit champions whose skills ignore shield completely.                                                                                                                    |

Improves damage from skills and Tier 6 masteries (Warmaster/Giant Slayer). Does NOT enhance Poison or HP Burn damage.                                                                                                                         |

Does not apply to Spider's Den Spiderlings. Not recommended for speed-tuned teams unless there's sufficient speed gap.
