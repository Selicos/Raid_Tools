  "description": "2:1 speed tune allows champions to take 2 turns for every 1 CB turn. This DOUBLES damage potential (2× turns = 2× damage) and increases buff/debuff uptime significantly. HOWEVER, requires EXTREME speed (250-280+ SPD) and precise speed tuning (exact SPD thresholds, no flexibility). VERY DIFFICULT to build for most rosters.",

    "explanation": "CB SPD is 170. For 2:1 ratio, champion SPD must be EXACTLY 2× CB SPD (340+ SPD ideal), BUT practical range is 250-280 SPD due to game mechanics (turn meter fills in increments, not continuous). Champions at 250-280 SPD can maintain 2:1 ratio with careful tuning.",
    "formula": "CB SPD 170 × 2 = 340 SPD (ideal). Practical minimum: 250 SPD (with specific gear + speed lead + speed aura). Above 280 SPD requires EXTREME gear (near-perfect SPD rolls on all pieces).",
    "exact_tuning_required": "Unlike 1:1 tune (171-189 SPD = 18 SPD flexibility), 2:1 tune requires EXACT SPD values (e.g., 267 SPD, 273 SPD). Off by 5 SPD = tune breaks, champions take 1 turn per CB turn instead of 2."
