      "PRIORITY SUPPORT T6: Master Hexer (CRITICAL for Poison extension - A2 places 2x Poison debuffs for 2 turns, Master Hexer extends to 3 turns = 50% more damage), Lasting Gifts (CRITICAL for Continuous Heal extension - A2 places 2x Continuous Heal for 2 turns, Lasting Gifts extends to 3 turns = 50% more healing), Eagle Eye (CRITICAL +50 ACC for Poison consistency - need 250+ ACC Clan Boss, 200+ dungeons).",

Master Hexer extends Poison duration (2→3 turns) for massive damage increase. Lasting Gifts extends Continuous Heal duration (2→3 turns) for 50% more healing.",
