      "PRIORITY SUPPORT T6: Master Hexer (CRITICAL for HP Burn extension - A1 has 35% base chance to extend, Master Hexer adds 30% chance to extend on placement → HP Burn lasts 2→3+ turns for sustained damage on Spider/Hydra/bosses). Eagle Eye (CRITICAL +50 ACC for HP Burn consistency - need 200+ ACC dungeons, 250+ Doom Tower Hard).",

Passive destroys MAX HP when HP Burn activates (5% per activation, 50% max) but grants scaling stats (+1% DMG/C.DMG/DEF per 1% destroyed, +2 SPD/RES per 1%). A3 restores destroyed MAX HP by 10% per HP Burn placed (self-sustain). Build for HP% (large MAX HP pool for passive scaling), SPD (200+), ACC (200+ dungeons, 250+ Hard Doom Tower with Eagle Eye).",
