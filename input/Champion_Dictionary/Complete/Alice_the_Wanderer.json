      "- Cycle of Violence: 30% chance to reduce cooldown when damage exceeds 30% of target MAX HP → synergizes with passive cooldown reset on kill",
      "- Kill Streak: +6% damage per kill (max +12%) → snowball damage in waves",
      "- Eagle Eye + Pinpoint Accuracy: High ACC required for A2 cooldown increase (75% chance) and TM manipulation",

A3 chains to lowest HP enemy if first target dies (both hits ignore 20% DEF). Passive resets one skill cooldown per kill (once per skill).
