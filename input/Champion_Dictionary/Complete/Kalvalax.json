Scales with Poison count for massive MAX HP damage). Warmaster is SUBOPTIMAL for Kalvalax (A2 multi-hit benefits more from Giant Slayer). NOTE: Arena can use Helmsmasher for burst damage if not using Poison setup.",

A3 damage scales with Poison count. Passive places 2x Poison on self-damage. Master Hexer extends all Poison for 50% more damage + more A2 hits), Eagle Eye (CRITICAL +50 ACC for Poison consistency - need 250+ ACC Clan Boss/Doom Tower).",

      "SYNERGIES: A2 'Serpent Fang' multi-hit mechanic (1 base hit + up to 3 extra hits for each Poison debuff = 1-4 total hits) synergizes with Giant Slayer (30% proc per hit). A1 extends Poison duration by 1 turn (40% base, 60% booked) + heals 2.5% MAX HP per Poison debuff. A3 AoE damage scales with Poison count. Passive places 2x Poison debuffs on ally taking fatal hit (50% chance, saves ally + sets up A2 multi-hit). Master Hexer extends ALL Poison from 2→3 turns for 50% more damage + more consistent A2 multi-hit. Build for 250+ ACC (with Eagle Eye), 200+ SPD, HP%/DEF% for survivability.",
      "UNIQUE MECHANICS: A2 hit count scales with Poison debuffs on target (1-4 hits total). More Poison = more hits = more Giant Slayer procs. A1/A3 damage scales with Poison count. Passive saves ally from fatal hit by placing 2x Poison on them (cheese synergy for ally survival + A2 setup). Entire kit revolves around Poison stacking.",
      "POISON SYNERGY: Kalvalax needs Poison support (Frozen Banshee, Elenaril, Narma, etc.) to maximize A2 multi-hit damage. Without Poison setup, A2 is only 1-hit (Giant Slayer still works but not optimal). Master Hexer extends Poison duration for sustained multi-hit damage."
