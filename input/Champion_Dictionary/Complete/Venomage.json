Synergizes with A3.\n6. **ACC Aura** - +45 ACC aura for all battles, helpful for early/mid game teams lacking ACC.\n\n**Best Use Cases**:\n- **Scarab King (DT)**: Heal Reduction prevents shield healing, poison kills boss.\n- **Clan Boss**: Poison stacking (not top tier, but usable if lacking better poisoners like Frozen Banshee).\n- **Doom Tower Bosses**: Heal Reduction shuts down healing mechanics on certain bosses.\n- **Lizardmen FW**: Poison and Decrease DEF excellent for faction progression.\n\n**Limitations**:\n- **Low priority** vs top-tier poisoners (Frozen Banshee, Elenaril, etc.).\n- **No TM control** or hard CC, limiting dungeon/arena use.\n- **ATK-based scaling** - squishier than DEF-based champions, requires HP%/DEF% investment.\n- **Conditional A2 Decrease ATK** - requires poison first, not always reliable.\n\n**Synergies**:\n- **CB**: Pairs with Frozen Banshee (more poison), Geomancer (HP Burn), Rhazin (Decrease DEF backup), Skullcrusher (counterattack).\n- **DT/Scarab**: Pairs with poison specialists, revive champs (Scyl, Rector Drath), HP Burn (Ninja).\n- **FW**: Pairs with Rhazin (Decrease DEF/Weaken), any Lizardmen DPS.\n\n**Booking Priority**: A3 FIRST (100% Heal Reduction/Poison proc + cooldown reduction), then A2 (100% Decrease DEF + cooldown), then A1 (poison chance).
