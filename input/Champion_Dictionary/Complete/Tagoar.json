HellHades: 'Top tier Epic champion', 'Worth considering for Teleria's top tier Epics'. Community comparison to Duchess Lilitu (Legendary): Similar kit (revive all + sustain + damage reduction), worse individual abilities (30% vs 50% revive HP, 20% shield vs Veil, 10% damage reduction vs 25% AOE reduction, Increase DEF vs Perfect Veil), but EPIC rarity = easier to obtain/book (10 tomes vs Legendary). Community debate: 'Tagoar S+++ tier', 'Epic Arbiter type', 'Better than Uugo?' (controversial). SKILL ANALYSIS: A1 Da Magic Stick (2-hit 1.8 ATK, Increase DEF 60% lowest HP 2 turns) - SUPPORT UTILITY. Low damage but buff critical for squishy champions (Robar, Galek Orcs). A2 Charge Cant (AOE 3.7 ATK, Increase SPD 30% all 2 turns, heal 25% MAX HP all, CD 5→3 booked) - CORE SUSTAIN. Scales with Tagoar HP (60k = 15k heal, 80k = 20k heal). Warmaster synergy AOE damage. Speed manipulation for 2:1 CB tuning. MUST BOOK cooldown 5→3 (100% uptime speed). A3 Rise and Fight (revive all 30% HP, shield all 20% MAX HP 2 turns, CD 7→5 booked) - GAME-CHANGING RECOVERY. Full team revive (not conditional like Uugo/Rector Drath), usable anytime (AI wastes on shield spam). Shield prevents immediate re-death (60k HP = 12k shield, 80k HP = 16k shield). MUST BOOK cooldown 7→5. Passive Aid the Feeble (reduce damage 10% allies <50% HP) - DUCHESS-LITE. Synergy with A3 revive (revived allies 30% HP = <50% threshold = 10% reduction). AURA: +25% HP all battles = 8★ UTILITY. Community: '+25% HP Aura enabled Artak stay alive FW21'. Critical for squishy Orcs (low base HP faction). COMMUNITY QUOTES: 'Essentially Epic Duchess', 'One tough cookie', 'Carried Doom Tower/Nightmare Campaign/FW21 early account', 'Epic Arbiter type', 'Better than Scyl for CB sustain', 'S tier Epic minimum'. TAGOAR VS UUGO DEBATE: Community split. Pro-Tagoar: 'Full revive usable anytime', 'Easier to build (no ACC needed)', 'Faster base SPD 105 vs Uugo 102', '10 tomes vs Uugo 16 tomes', 'Better FW carry', 'Tanky + heal sustain'. Pro-Uugo: 'Decrease DEF + Block Buffs + Cleanse = debuffer utility', 'Better CB/Arena debuffer', 'Leech synergy'. Consensus: Different roles (Tagoar sustain/revive, Uugo debuffer/control). Both S-tier Epics. BUILD PRIORITY: HP% 60k-80k+ mandatory (heal/shield scaling). SPD 200-220+ (turn cycling). DEF%/RES survivability (tank support). NO ACC needed (no debuffs). Regen + Immortal or 3x Speed sets. MUST BOOK A2+A3 cooldowns (10 tomes total). MUST mastery (Timely Intervention T6 for revive cooldown or Warmaster T6 for CB damage). USE CASE: Faction Wars MVP (10/10 rating), early account blessing (Campaign/Doom Tower carry), Chimera beast, CB 2:1 speed tune support, Arena defense cheese (last-man revive). PATCH HISTORY: Patch 6.22 Nov 2022 updates (unknown buffs). VERDICT: TOP TIER EPIC SUPPORT. Build immediately if pulled early/mid game. Faction Wars carry.
