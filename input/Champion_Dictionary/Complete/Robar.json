Historical issues: Low base SPD 87 (slowest in game), poor AI, underwhelming damage. Patch 4.70 fixes: AI tool addition (manual skill priority), base SPD buff 87→97, skill adjustments. Community consensus: 'One of most enjoyable Raid videos' (HellHades), 'Top 5 Arena nuker', 'World destroyer'. SKILL ANALYSIS: A1 Stunning Strength (3.4 ATK, 50% Stun, grants Extra Turn if stun lands) - TURN CYCLING ENGINE. Relentless set = 68% extra turn chance, can chain 3-4 consecutive stuns. A2 Wild Swing (4.3 ATK AOE, 75%→100% Decrease DEF 60% 2 turns booked, CD 4→3 booked) - SETUP DEBUFFER. MUST BOOK for 100% uptime Decrease DEF. A3 Merciless Assault (4.2 ATK AOE, +50% damage vs Fear/True Fear/Freeze/Provoke/Sleep/Stun) - HARDEST HITTING AOE IN RAID (6.3 effective multiplier vs controlled enemies). Community tested: 150k+ hits Arena. AURA: +50 ACC Faction Crypts (Orcs only) - specialized FW utility. PAIRING STRATEGY: MUST pair with control champions for A3 damage boost. Best combos: Kymar (AOE Fear + skill reset), Lyssandra (AOE Freeze + TM boost), Psylar (AOE Decrease SPD + stun set), Umbral Enchantress (AOE Provoke). Speed tune: Controller first → Robar nukes (low base SPD 97 issue). CLAN BOSS CONTROVERSY: Originally rated 5★ CB (Ayumilove) → downgraded 4★ after community backlash. Community: 'Just Decrease DEF not 5★', 'Tomb Lord (DEF+ATK down + poisons + 3-hit A1) only 3★ but Robar 5★?'. Ayumilove response: 'Robar 60% Decrease DEF 100% uptime useful' → downgraded anyway. Reality: Weak CB choice (no multi-hit for Warmaster, no other utility, Force affinity weak vs Spirit CB). VERDICT: TOP TIER ARENA SPECIALIST. Build for arena one-shot nuking (Savage+Cruel, 300%+ C.DMG, pair with controllers). Avoid CB (use Rhazin/Drexthar for Decrease DEF). Relentless cheese viable for stun lock fun.
