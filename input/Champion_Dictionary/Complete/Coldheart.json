However, Giant Slayer is viable if focusing on A2 damage for wave clear. RECOMMENDATION: Warmaster for boss nuking (standard build). Eagle Eye CRITICAL (+50 ACC for 200+ total, reliable TM decrease on A1/A2). Cycle of Magic CRITICAL (reduces A2 4→3 turns booked, A3 5→4 turns booked for more frequent TM control/nukes).
