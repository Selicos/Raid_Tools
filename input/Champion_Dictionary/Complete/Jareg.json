WEAKNESS: Low base SPD (96) makes 2:1 Clan Boss tune very difficult (needs +167-184 SPD from gear). Best in 1:1 tune (171-191 SPD). Replace with Decrease ATK champions like Tayrel/Stag Knight/Sandlashed Survivor when roster matures. FACTION WARS MVP: HP aura + passive heal critical for Lizardmen Stage 21 (boss ignores DEF).",

  "comments": "Jareg is one of the best Epic champions for early-mid game Clan Boss progression. His Decrease ATK debuff (A1) is critical for team survivability, and Pack Leader (A2) with Ally Protection + Inc DEF is a defensive powerhouse. The passive Continuous Heal (Sheltering Scales) provides emergency sustain in Faction Wars and vs hard-hitting bosses. HP aura 33% works in all battles (dungeons, FW, CB). LIMITATIONS: Low base SPD (96) makes 2:1 Clan Boss tune impractical (needs +167-184 SPD). Best in 1:1 tune (171-191 SPD). Not viable for Arena (no burst/control). Replace in late-game Clan Boss with stronger Decrease ATK champions (Tayrel, Stag Knight) or unkillable comps. FACTION WARS: MVP for Lizardmen - HP aura + passive heal essential for Stage 21 boss (ignores defense). Fully book A1 and A2 (7 tomes total). Run Warmaster + Lifesteal set for Clan Boss sustain.",
