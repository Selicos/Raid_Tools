Counter enables slow progression teams.\n\nKEY SYNERGIES:\n- Multi-hitters: Coldheart, Fellhound, Royal Guard (FK shield break)\n- Poisoners: Frozen Banshee, Deadwood Jedi, Kael (CB damage)\n- DEF-based DPS: Tayrel, Sepulcher Sentinel (scales with his buffs)\n- Decrease ATK: Jareg, Tayrel, Coffin Smasher (reduces damage he tanks)\n\nAVOID PAIRING WITH:\n- TM manipulators in CB: High Khatun, Apothecary (breaks speed tune)\n- Other Counterattack champions: Buffs don't stack, wasted slot\n\nSPEED TUNING:\n- CB Brutal/NM: 171-180 SPD (2:1 tune possible)\n- CB UNM: 171-191 SPD (depends on comp, goes first OR last depending on strategy)\n- Dungeons: 180-200 SPD (fast cycling)\n- Arena: 200-250 SPD (goes last after setup)\n\nBOOKING PRIORITY: A2 ONLY (5 books).
