Expanded cheese_strategy to comprehensive documentation (6 specific comps with mechanics, notes, requirements, strengths, weaknesses). Added extensive mechanics_advisory (Patch 4.70 changes, damage benchmarks, build priorities). Added validation_metadata (100% confidence). Added author field. Fixed aura placement (moved to root from forms array). Fixed A3 effects (was null, now 3 detailed effect objects). Changed draft from undefined to false. Template-compliant with all Pain Keeper/Skullcrusher/Frozen Banshee standards.",
