When deflecting damage, on each hit, has a 30% chance of dealing additional damage equal to 3% of the target’s MAX HP.\nNote: In Patch 4.70, the Stoneguard passive skill has been adjusted. The reflected damage is now classified as “damage reflect” rather than a “damage hit.” Consequently, this change prevents it from triggering the Giant Slayer or Warmaster masteries, and it also disables the effects of certain artifact sets like Stun, Lifesteal, and Toxic. To optimize Geomancer’s performance, it’s advisable to switch his Tier 6 Offense mastery to Warmaster, as this mastery now offers a higher activation chance, thereby enhancing his overall damage output.",
