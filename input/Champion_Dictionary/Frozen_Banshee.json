  "mechanics_advisory": "Frozen Banshee is a Rare champion with S-tier Clan Boss value. Her poison output rivals or exceeds most Legendaries when built correctly. Post-Patch 1.13.5 AI improvements make her reliable on auto.\n\n**CORE STRENGTHS:**\n\n1. **CLAN BOSS (10/10):** THE budget poison champion. With Poison Sensitivity active, she applies 2x 5% poisons per A1 attack. In counterattack comps, this is 2-4 poisons per boss turn. Typical CB damage: 15-25M (Budget Unkillable), 20-35M (Counterattack), 25-40M (with Vizier). MUST be fully booked and speed-tuned.\n\n2. **DUNGEONS (8/10):** Excellent for Dragon 25, Ice Golem 25, and Magma Dragon (Doom Tower). A1 multi-hit helps FK shield. Poison Sensitivity amplifies team poison damage. ACC aura supports debuffers.\n\n3. **DOOM TOWER (7/10):** Strong for boss fights requiring poison (Magma Dragon, Nether Spider, Eternal Dragon). Needs high ACC for DT Hard bosses (300-350).\n\n4. **FACTION WARS (6/10):** Solid Undead Hordes support. ACC aura is valuable. Poison damage helps boss stages. Low base stats limit wave clear.\n\n5. **ARENA (5/10):** Not recommended - better options exist. Poison is slow damage in speed-meta arena. Only viable in tanky stall comps.\n\n**KEY MECHANICS:**\n\n- **Poison Dependency:** A1 poisons ONLY work if Poison Sensitivity (A3) is active. MUST apply A3 first.\n- **Speed Tuning:** In Budget Unkillable/speed-tuned comps, she MUST go in specific order. Disable A2 to avoid TM manipulation.\n- **Master Hexer:** CRITICAL mastery - extends Poison Sensitivity from 2→3 turns, enabling near-permanent uptime on CB.\n- **ACC Requirements:** 250+ for UNM CB, 200-250 for dungeons, 300-350 for DT Hard bosses. Non-negotiable.\n- **Booking Priority:** A3 first (reduce CD 5→3), then A1 (100% poison chance), A2 last (optional - many skip for CB).\n\n**SYNERGY NOTES:**\n\n- Works with ANY Clan Boss comp as long as speed-tuned correctly\n- Pairs excellently with Vizier Ovelis (debuff extension)\n- Synergizes with Decrease DEF/Weaken for more damage from Warmaster\n- Requires support for survivability (Decrease ATK, Ally Protection, Healing)\n\n**COMMON MISTAKES:**\n\n- Using without booking A1/A3 → unreliable poison application\n- Not disabling A2 in speed-tuned comps → breaks rotation\n- Insufficient ACC → debuffs resisted, damage plummets\n- Building ATK% → poison damage doesn't scale with ATK, focus survivability\n- Pairing with too many poisoners → hit debuff limit, waste slots\n\n**BOTTOM LINE:**\n\nFrozen Banshee is S-tier for Clan Boss despite being Rare. She enables budget players to compete in UNM and is a core champion for many endgame CB teams. DO NOT FEED. Fully book A1/A3, get ACC to 250+, speed tune correctly, and she will carry CB damage for months or years.",
