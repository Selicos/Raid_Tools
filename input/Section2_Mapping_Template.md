# Section 2: Champion-to-Mechanics Mapping Template

**Use this template for Section 2 of boss guides to map owned champions to boss mechanics and trial requirements.**

## 2. Champion-to-Mechanics Mapping

This section maps **owned champions only** to boss mechanics, trials, and stat requirements. Use this to identify which champions can fulfill specific roles and which mechanics/trials have gaps.

### 2.1 Per-Mechanic Mapping

#### Mechanic/Trial 1: [Name, e.g., "HP Burn Application"]

**Requirement:** [Description, e.g., "Apply HP Burn debuff 10+ times for trial completion"]

| Champion | Affinity | Skill | Cooldown | Landing Chance | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|----------------|-------|
| [Champion 1] | [Affinity] | [Skill name, e.g., A3] | [e.g., 3 turns] | [e.g., 100% with books] | [Notes, e.g., "AoE HP Burn, hits all enemies"] |
| [Champion 2] | [Affinity] | [Skill name] | [Cooldown] | [Landing Chance] | [Notes] |
| [Champion 3] | [Affinity] | [Skill name] | [Cooldown] | [Landing Chance] | [Notes] |

**Affinity Safety:**
- [Champion 1]: [Safe/Risky] vs [Boss Affinity] boss
- [Champion 2]: [Safe/Risky] vs [Boss Affinity] boss

## Example: Section 2 for Dragon Hard

### 2.1 Per-Mechanic Mapping

#### Mechanic/Trial 1: HP Burn Application

**Requirement:** Apply HP Burn debuff 10+ times for trial completion

| Champion | Affinity | Skill | Cooldown | Landing Chance | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|----------------|-------|
| Mordecai | Magic | A3 (Conflagration) | 3 turns | 100% with books | AoE HP Burn, hits all enemies (5 applications per use) |

| Ultimate Galek | Void | A3 (Burn the Bones) | 4 turns | 100% with books | AoE HP Burn, lower damage than Mordecai |

**Affinity Safety:**
- Mordecai: Safe vs Spirit Dragon (strong affinity)
- Ninja: Risky vs Force Dragon (weak affinity, may miss HP Burn 30% of time)
- Ultimate Galek: Safe vs all Dragon affinities (Void)

**Gap Analysis:** Sufficient coverage (3 owned champions). Prefer Mordecai for AoE HP Burn efficiency, Ultimate Galek for affinity safety, Ninja for single-target damage.

#### Mechanic/Trial 2: Decrease DEF Application

**Requirement:** Apply Decrease DEF debuff 15+ times for trial completion

| Champion | Affinity | Skill | Cooldown | Landing Chance | Notes |

| Warmaiden | Spirit | A3 (Warmaiden's Cry) | 4 turns | 100% with books | AoE Decrease DEF, F2P option |

**Affinity Safety:**
- Stag Knight: Risky vs Force Dragon (weak affinity, may miss debuff 30% of time)
- Dhukk the Pierced: Safe vs Magic Dragon (strong affinity), risky vs Spirit Dragon
- Warmaiden: Risky vs Force Dragon (weak affinity)

**Affinity Safety:**
- Reliquary Tender: Safe vs all Dragon affinities (Void)
- Scyl of the Drakes: Safe vs all Dragon affinities (Void)

## Notes

- **Always list only owned champions** in Section 2 tables
- **Include affinity safety/risk** for every champion (critical for boss with rotating affinities)
- **Document gaps** so user knows which champions to prioritize pulling
- **Prioritize multi-mechanic champions** in team building (fewer slots needed)
- **Update Section 2** whenever owned champion list changes (new additions may fill gaps)
