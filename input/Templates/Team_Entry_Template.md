## Example Team Entry

### Team 1: High Damage HP Burn Manual

**Core Roles:** HP Burn (Damage Dealer), Decrease DEF (Debuffer), Ally Attack (Buffer), Revive (Support), Cleanser

**Optimal Combo:**
- Mordecai (HP Burn Damage Dealer)
- Stag Knight (Decrease DEF/ATK Debuffer)
- Longbeard (Ally Attack Buffer)
- Vogoth (Leech Tank/Support)
- Reliquary Tender (Cleanser/Healer)

**Alternates:**
- **HP Burn:** Ninja (higher single-target damage), Ultimate Galek (AoE HP Burn but lower damage)
- **Decrease DEF:** Warmaiden (F2P option, lower ACC), Dhukk the Pierced (also provides Decrease ATK)
- **Ally Attack:** Skullcrusher (Counterattack alternate), Lanakis (also provides SPD buff)
- **Revive/Support:** Scyl of the Drakes (also provides Stun), Bad-el-Kazar (also provides continuous heal)
- **Cleanser:** Mausoleum Mage (also provides Increase ATK), Doompriest (passive cleanse, speed-tuned)

**Speed Tuning:** Flexible turn order, prioritize Decrease DEF before HP Burn application
- Stag Knight: 220-250 SPD (goes first to apply Decrease DEF)
- Mordecai: 200-220 SPD (applies HP Burn after Decrease DEF)
- Longbeard: 180-200 SPD (Ally Attack after HP Burn applied)
- Reliquary Tender: 160-180 SPD (cleanses debuffs mid-rotation)
- Vogoth: 140-160 SPD (tanks, applies Leech)
- **Notes:** Speed tuning not strict, but Decrease DEF before HP Burn maximizes damage

**Gear:**
- **Mordecai:** Savage + Crit Rate | Stats: 200+ SPD, 100% Crit Rate, 200%+ Crit Damage, 250+ ACC (for HP Burn landing)
- **Stag Knight:** Speed + Accuracy | Stats: 250+ SPD, 300+ ACC, 35k+ HP (survivability)
- **Longbeard:** Speed + Immortal | Stats: 220+ SPD, 50k+ HP, 200+ RES (resist boss debuffs)
- **Vogoth:** Shield + Immortal | Stats: 80k+ HP, 4k+ DEF, 150+ SPD (tank role)
- **Reliquary Tender:** Speed + Immortal | Stats: 200+ SPD, 40k+ HP, 200+ RES (cleanse timing)

**Masteries:**
- **Damage Dealers (Mordecai):** Warmaster (T6 offense tree)
- **Support (Stag Knight, Longbeard, Reliquary Tender):** Support tree (Cycle of Magic, Lore of Steel)
- **Tank (Vogoth):** Defense tree (Improved Parry, Deterrence)

**Manual/Auto:** Manual recommended for optimal damage, can work on auto with lower performance
- **Auto:** Partial - HP Burn application may be suboptimal, Ally Attack timing may vary
- **Manual Advice:** Turn 1: Stag Knight A3 (Decrease DEF/ATK). Turn 2: Mordecai A3 (HP Burn). Turn 3: Longbeard A3 (Ally Attack). Maintain debuff uptime throughout fight.
- **AI Presets:** Use "Opener" AI preset for Stag Knight A3, "Nuker" for Mordecai A3

**Strengths:**
- High damage output (18M+ average, 22M max observed)
- Completes HP Burn trial consistently (10+ HP Burns per run)
- Completes Decrease DEF trial (15+ applications)
- Vogoth provides Leech sustain (no manual healing needed)
- Safe affinity (4/5 champions Void or neutral)

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires manual play for optimal performance (10-15% damage loss on auto)
- High gear requirements (Mordecai needs 250+ ACC, 100% Crit Rate, 200%+ Crit Damage)
- Stag Knight weak affinity vs Force bosses (may miss Decrease DEF 30% of time)
- Slow clear time (4-5 minutes per run due to HP Burn DoT damage)
- No emergency revive if Vogoth dies early (team can collapse)

**Simulated Results:**
- **Clear Time (Avg):** 4:15 average over 10 runs (3:45 fastest, 5:00 slowest)
- **Damage (Avg):** 18.5M average, 22M max, 15M min
- **Trials Completed:** HP Burn (10/10), Decrease DEF (10/10), Ally Attack (8/10)
- **Success Rate:** 9/10 runs successful, 1 fail due to Stag Knight dying early (weak affinity vs Force boss)
- **Simulation Details:** Tested 2025-10-18, 10 runs, manual play, Hard difficulty

**Affinity Safety/Risk:**
```
Affinity Safety/Risk:
- Mordecai (Magic): Safe vs Spirit boss, strong affinity
  * Reliable HP Burn landing (250+ ACC observed)
  * High damage output (18M+ average)
- Stag Knight (Spirit): Risky vs Force boss, weak affinity
  * May miss Decrease DEF 30% of time (60% weak hit rate observed)
  * Consider alternate if boss is Force affinity (use Dhukk the Pierced instead)
- Longbeard (Void): Safe (neutral vs all affinities)
- Vogoth (Void): Safe (neutral vs all affinities)
- Reliquary Tender (Void): Safe (neutral vs all affinities)

Overall Risk: Low-Medium
- Only 1 champion (Stag Knight) has weak affinity risk
- Risk is in non-critical role (Decrease DEF can be alternated)
- If boss is Force affinity, replace Stag Knight with Dhukk the Pierced (Force affinity, safe vs Magic boss)
```

**Actionable Trial/Mechanic Advice:**
- **HP Burn Trial (Complete 10 HP Burns):**
  * Turn 1: Stag Knight A3 (Decrease DEF/ATK)
  * Turn 2: Mordecai A3 (HP Burn all enemies)
  * Turn 5: Mordecai A3 ready again (3-turn CD with books)
  * Result: 10+ HP Burns by turn 10 (5 enemies × 2 applications)
- **Decrease DEF Trial (Apply Decrease DEF 15 times):**
  * Turn 1: Stag Knight A3 (AoE Decrease DEF, hits 5 enemies = 5 applications)
  * Turn 4: Stag Knight A3 ready again (3-turn CD with books, hits 5 enemies = 5 applications)
  * Turn 7: Stag Knight A3 ready again (5 applications)
  * Result: 15 applications by turn 7
- **Boss Wave (Manual):**
  * Turn 1: Stag Knight A3 (Decrease DEF/ATK on boss)
  * Turn 2: Mordecai A3 (HP Burn boss + adds)
  * Turn 3: Longbeard A3 (Ally Attack, entire team attacks boss)
  * Turn 4-10: Maintain HP Burn uptime, reapply Decrease DEF when ready
  * Turn 10+: Boss should be low HP, finish with Ally Attack or focused damage

**When to Use This Team:**
- Manual play with high damage focus (18M+ target)
- HP Burn trial completion needed
- Decrease DEF trial completion needed
- Boss is Spirit or Void affinity (safe matchup for Mordecai)

**When NOT to Use This Team:**
- Auto-only farming (requires manual for optimal performance)
- Boss is Force affinity AND Stag Knight is critical (replace with Dhukk the Pierced)
- Low gear quality (Mordecai needs 250+ ACC, 100% Crit Rate, 200%+ Crit Damage)
- Fast clear time needed (this team is slow, 4-5 minutes per run)
