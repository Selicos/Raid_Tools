Your current Hard Spider team with Underpriest Brogni and Godseeker Aniri forms a strong defensive and sustain core. To complete a successful team, you’ll need to add high single-target damage, turn meter control, and either cleanse or crowd control. Poison is viable but requires layering and support. Below is a full review of your roster and strategic recommendations.

🧙‍♂️ Core Champions (Locked In)
Champion	Role	Notes
Underpriest Brogni	Shield + reflect damage	Excellent for spiderling mitigation and passive healing
Godseeker Aniri	Buff extension + revive	Keeps shields and heals active longer, covers revive needs
⚔️ Champion Review: Damage, Utility, and Support Potential
🔥 Damage Dealers
Coldheart – Enemy MAX HP, TM reduction; top-tier for Spider boss nuking

Royal Guard – Similar to Coldheart; AoE Enemy MAX HP + Decrease DEF

Septimus – Single-target burst + TM control; strong but needs setup

Ninja – HP Burn, Freeze, TM control; less effective in Hard Spider due to HP Burn immunity

Michelangelo – Decrease ATK, Leech, Taunt; good spiderling tank and control

Sun Wukong – Stun, TM steal, Ignore DEF; decent PvE damage and disruption

Alice the Wanderer – Cooldown increase, Ignore DEF; strong single-target burst

Mistrider Daithi – Extra turns, Decrease DEF; good for wave content, less ideal for Spider boss

Crohnam – HP Burn, TM boost; not optimal for Hard Spider

Artak – HP Burn, Burn detonation; replace for Hard Spider

🧪 Poison / Debuff Layering
Venomage – Poison, Heal reduction, Decrease DEF; strong if paired with other poisoners

Fayne – Poison, Weaken, Decrease DEF; high damage potential

Narma the Returned – Poison, Debuff extension, Healing; excellent synergy with Venomage

Stag Knight – Decrease DEF + ATK; versatile and reliable debuffer

🛡️ Support / Cleanse / Control
Tagoar – Cleanse, Heal, Increase DEF; ideal for spiderling poison mitigation

Maulie Tankard – Provoke, Revive, TM boost; good spiderling control

Scyl of the Drakes – Passive heal, Stun, Revive; strong sustain and CC

Rector Drath – Revive, Perfect Veil, Heal; great for spiderling targeting avoidance

Skullcrusher – Counterattack, Ally Protection; risky in spiderling-heavy fights

Deacon Armstrong – TM boost, Decrease DEF; speeds up team and softens boss

Archmage Hellmut – Increase SPD, Stun, TM boost; good tempo control

Mithrala – Shield, Debuff cleanse, Hex; strong hybrid support

Loki the Deceiver – Buff steal, TM control, Veil; niche utility

Embrys – True Fear, Decrease ATK, Necrosis scaling; strong PvE disruptor

Criodan – Freeze, Speed boost, TM fill; useful for spiderling control

Mosaleum Mage – Cleanse, Shield, Block debuffs; solid sustain option

The Black Knight – Provoke, Unkillable, Heal; tanky but slow tempo
