## General Speed Tuning Tips
- All champions should be tuned to go before the Clan Boss AOE (unless running a true unkillable/counterattack comp).
- Use a speed calculator (DeadwoodJedi, Ayumilove) to fine-tune based on your actual gear and team order.
- If you have to adjust for gear limitations, keep the same order: TM boosters and buff extenders fastest, then poisoners/damage dealers.
- For 2:1 speed tunes (advanced), all speeds must be 260–280+ and require careful calculator use.
