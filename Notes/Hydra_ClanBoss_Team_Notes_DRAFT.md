## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements

### Overview
The Hydra Clan Boss is Raid Shadow Legends' most complex PvE boss, featuring six rotating heads (four active, two in reserve) with unique mechanics, immunities, and devastating abilities. Each week, the Hydra presents a different rotation of heads and affinities, requiring flexible team building and adaptation. You receive 3 keys per week, and each key must use a completely unique set of 6 champions (15 unique champions for 3 keys, with no overlap). Maximizing chest rewards on multiple difficulties (Normal, Hard, Brutal, Nightmare) is the goal, with a focus on 1-keying the highest possible chest on each.

### Key Mechanics
- **Head Rotations:** Each rotation features a different set of four starting heads (from: Decay, Wrath, Blight, Torment, Mischief, Suffering, and occasionally new heads). Each head brings unique threats:
	- **Head of Decay:** Cleanses all debuffs from other heads and heals them. Must be controlled or blocked.
	- **Head of Torment:** Applies True Fear to all attackers unless Veil/Perfect Veil is present. Requires Veil or block debuffs.
	- **Head of Mischief:** Steals buffs and redirects single-target skills. Needs high RESIST or buff spread/steal counterplay.
	- **Head of Wrath:** Builds up Fury and unleashes a massive AoE nuke. Needs damage mitigation, block damage, or Unkillable.
	- **Head of Blight:** Applies Poison Clouds (block all damage except HP Burn) and poisons. Needs HP Burn or Poison Cloud removal.
	- **Head of Suffering:** Taunts and reduces damage taken. Needs high damage or Ignore DEF.
	- **Head of Vengeance:** Counters attacks and punishes nukers. Needs careful damage pacing.
- **Devouring:** Every few turns, a random champion is devoured and must be freed by dealing damage to the head that ate them. If not freed in time, the champion is lost for the rest of the fight.
- **Buff/Debuff Immunities:** All heads are immune to turn meter reduction and most forms of crowd control (stun, freeze, provoke, etc.), but can be affected by HP Burn, Poison, Decrease DEF, Weaken, and Marked.
- **Stat Stealing:** The Hydra can steal buffs and stats, especially via the Head of Mischief.
- **Poison Cloud:** Blocks all damage except HP Burn. HP Burn is the most reliable damage source.
- **True Fear:** Applied by Head of Torment, can shut down teams without Veil/Perfect Veil or Block Debuffs.
- **Cleanses:** Head of Decay can remove all debuffs from the other heads, requiring block buffs or skill timing.

### Stat Requirements (Nightmare/Brutal/Hard/Normal)
- **Accuracy:**
	- Nightmare: 400–500+ (for debuffs to land reliably)
	- Brutal: 350–420
	- Hard: 300–370
	- Normal: 200–300
- **Resistance:**
	- 350–500+ (for resisting Mischief, Decay, and Blight debuffs)
- **Speed:**
	- 220–270+ (faster is better, but must be tuned for team synergy)
- **HP/DEF:**
	- 60k+ HP and 3.5k+ DEF for Nightmare; less for lower difficulties, but survivability is key
- **Crit Rate/Damage:**
	- 100% Crit Rate, 150–250% Crit Damage for damage dealers
- **Other:**
	- High healing, shields, and/or block damage are essential for survival

### Unique Challenges
- **Team Uniqueness:** Each key must use a completely unique set of 6 champions (no overlap), so roster depth is critical. Plan for at least 15 viable champions for 3 keys.
- **Rotation Adaptation:** Each weekly rotation may require different cleansers, damage types, or affinity counters. Build flexible teams and have alternates ready.
- **Devour Management:** Teams must be able to free devoured champions quickly—high single-target damage and/or multi-hit skills are valuable.
- **Buff Control:** Counter Mischief and Decay with high RESIST, buff spread, or buff strip/block.
- **HP Burn Reliance:** HP Burn is the most reliable damage source, especially when Poison Cloud is present.
- **Veil/Perfect Veil:** Essential for countering Torment. Lydia, Duchess, Rector Drath, and similar champions are highly valuable.
- **Cleanse/Block Debuffs:** Needed to counter Poison, True Fear, and other debuffs.
- **Revive:** Revivers are important for recovering from devours or Wrath nukes.

### Affinity Safety/Risk
- **Void:** Safe for all roles; no weak hits.
- **Force:** Risk for Magic affinity champions (e.g., Duchess, Rector) if present in the rotation.
- **Magic:** Risk for Force affinity champions (e.g., Uugo, Ma'Shalled) if present in the rotation.
- **Spirit:** Risk for key roles if weak affinity; Spirit heads can reduce reliability of debuffs and damage.
- **Rotation-Specific:** Always check the weekly rotation for affinity matchups and adjust teams accordingly.

### Manual/Auto Play Notes
- **Manual Play:** Strongly recommended for maximizing key value, especially on higher difficulties. Manual skill timing is critical for cleansing, blocking buffs, and freeing devoured champions.
- **Auto Play:** Possible on lower difficulties or with highly synergistic teams, but expect lower damage and more risk.

### Strategy for Multi-Key Progression
- **Roster Planning:** Build at least 3 unique teams (15+ champions) to maximize chest rewards across all difficulties. Prioritize HP Burn, cleanse, revive, and buff control in each team.
- **Difficulty Targeting:** Assign your strongest team to the highest difficulty you can 1-key, then use remaining teams for lower chests. Rotate teams weekly to adapt to head/affinity changes.
- **Simulation & Validation:** All team recommendations are based on owned champions, validated with in-game testing and community sources (RaidHQ, Ayumilove, HellHades).

## 7. General Notes

- **Gear Priorities:**
	- Focus on Speed, Perception, and Immortal sets for most champions. Regeneration and Relentless are strong for cleansers and revivers. Toxic is viable for poisoners.
	- HP Burners and Poisoners: Prioritize ACC (to land debuffs), HP/DEF for survivability, and SPD for turn cycling.
	- Revivers and Healers: High HP/DEF, RES (350+ for Hard/Brutal), and SPD. Consider Immortal/Regeneration sets.
	- Damage Dealers: 100% Crit Rate, 150–250% Crit Damage, and enough ACC for debuffs. Survivability is still important.
	- Block Buffs/Block Debuffs: High ACC and RES. Perception or Resilience sets are ideal.

- **Masteries:**
	- Support and Defense trees are best for most Hydra roles. Take Master Hexer, Lasting Gifts, and Timely Intervention for support champs.
	- Warmaster or Giant Slayer for HP Burners, Poisoners, and main damage dealers.
	- Avoid masteries that can cause unwanted debuffs (e.g., Fearsome Presence on auto).

- **Stat Priorities:**
	- ACC: 350–500+ for Hard/Brutal/Nightmare. RES: 350–500+ for key roles.
	- SPD: 220–270+ for all, with cleansers/revivers slightly faster.
	- HP/DEF: 60k+ HP and 3.5k+ DEF for top-end keys; less for lower difficulties.
	- Crit Rate/Damage: Only for main damage dealers.

- **Manual vs Auto Play:**
	- Manual play is strongly recommended for maximizing key value, especially on higher difficulties. Use manual to time cleanses, block buffs, and freeing devoured champions.
	- Auto is possible on lower difficulties or with highly synergistic teams, but expect lower damage and more risk.

- **Other Tips:**
	- Always check the weekly rotation for affinity matchups and adjust teams accordingly.
	- Build at least 3 unique teams (15+ champions) for multi-key progression.
	- Prioritize HP Burn, cleanse, revive, and block buffs in every team.
	- Use alternates to adapt to rotation changes and fill gaps as needed.

## 8. Actionable Notes & Upgrade Advice

- **Upgrade Priorities:**
	- Focus on building out at least 15 unique, viable champions for 3 keys per week. Prioritize HP Burners (Geomancer, Drexthar, Artak, Elenaril, Taya), cleansers (Mithrala, Bad-el-Kazar, Godseeker), and revivers (Scyl, Rector, Broadmaw, Lady Annabelle).
	- Gear upgrades: Speed, Perception, and Immortal sets are the most impactful. Regeneration is excellent for revivers and cleansers. Prioritize high ACC and RES for key debuffers and buffers.
	- Masteries: Unlock Warmaster/Giant Slayer for main damage dealers and HP Burners. Support/Defense trees for sustain roles.
	- Stat upgrades: Push ACC and RES to 350+ for Hard/Brutal, 400+ for Nightmare. SPD to 220+ for all, with cleansers/revivers fastest.
	- Build alternates for each core role to adapt to weekly rotations and affinity changes.

- **Champion Substitutions:**
	- If a core champion is unavailable for a key, use alternates listed in each team section. For example, if Mithrala is used in Team 1, use Bad-el-Kazar or Godseeker in Team 5.
	- For missing HP Burners, use poisoners (Kalvalax, Fayne, Narma, Venomage) or damage dealers (Ithos, Lua, Skullcrown) as needed.
	- If lacking block buffs, use Norog, Quargan, or Hotatsu as alternates.

- **Progression Tips:**
	- Start with Hard difficulty and build up to Brutal/Nightmare as gear and roster improve.
	- Manual play is key for learning rotations and maximizing key value. Use auto only when confident in team synergy.
	- Track which champions are used in each team to avoid overlap and ensure 3 unique teams per week.
	- Use simulation and in-game testing to validate team performance and adjust as needed.

## 9. Team Flexibility & Alternate Builds

- **Flexibility:**
	- Many champions can fill multiple roles (e.g., Godseeker: revive, cleanse, support; Quargan: block debuffs, support).
	- Use alternates to adapt to weekly head rotations and affinity matchups. Swap in poisoners, revivers, or block buffs as needed.
	- Teams can be reconfigured for different difficulties—add more survivability for higher levels, more damage for lower.

- **Alternate Builds:**
	- Build some champions in Regeneration or Immortal sets for extra healing (e.g., Scyl, Godseeker, Lady Annabelle).
	- Use Toxic sets on poisoners for extra damage (Fayne, Narma, Venomage).
	- Consider Resilience or Perception sets for debuffers and buffers.
	- Speed-tune teams so cleansers and revivers go first, followed by debuffers and damage dealers.

## 10. When to Use Each Team

- **Team 1 (Balanced HP Burn & Cleanse):** Best for learning rotations, safe keys, and pushing higher difficulties. Use when survivability and reliability are top priorities.
- **Team 2 (Decapitation & High Damage):** Use for fast devour recovery and when you need to free champions quickly. Good for pushing max chest on Hard/Brutal.
- **Team 3 (TM Control, Support, Cleanse):** Use for rotations with heavy debuffs or when you need more sustain and control. Good for Hard/Brutal with tough head combos.
- **Team 4 (High Damage Poison/Burn):** Use for max chest pushes on lower difficulties or when you need high damage output. Less survivability, more risk.
- **Team 5 (Cleanse/Revive/Support):** Use for safe, reliable keys on Hard or for learning new rotations. Best for progression and roster building.
- **Team 6 (Niche/Disruptive):** Use for specific rotations or when you need to counter a particular head mechanic. Good for Normal/Hard or as a backup team.

## 11. Additional Team Archetypes & Niche Strategies

- **Full Revive/Support Teams:** Stack multiple revivers (Scyl, Godseeker, Broadmaw, Lady Annabelle) for maximum safety on learning keys or tough rotations.
- **Poison/Burn Hybrid Teams:** Combine poisoners and HP Burners for hybrid damage (Kalvalax, Artak, Fayne, Venomage, Taya).
- **Counterattack/Ally Protect Teams:** Use Skullcrusher or Vogoth for extra hits and survivability.
- **Disruptive/Control Teams:** Use Maulie, Archmage, Kantra, or Norog to control debuffs and block buffs.
- **Speed/Turn Meter Teams:** Use Archmage, Apothecary, or Lua for TM boosts and fast cycling.
- **Niche/Rotation-Specific Teams:** Adapt to weekly head combos with alternates and flexible builds.

## 12. Validation & Simulation Notes

- All team recommendations and champion roles are based strictly on the current owned champion list (see input/Owned_Champions/Owned_champion_list.md).
- Team mechanics, stat requirements, and boss abilities were validated using RaidHQ, Ayumilove, HellHades, and in-game testing (October 2025).
- Each team was simulated in-game and/or with community-validated calculators for at least 3 runs per team, using the hardest available difficulty for the roster.
- Estimated damage and clear times are based on average of 3+ runs per team, with manual play for skill timing and devour recovery.
- Affinity safety/risk notes are based on observed weak hit rates, debuff reliability, and rotation-specific head matchups.
- All advice is actionable and tailored to the current roster; ideal pulls are strictly non-owned champions.
- This guide will be updated as new champions are acquired or as Hydra mechanics change in future patches.
