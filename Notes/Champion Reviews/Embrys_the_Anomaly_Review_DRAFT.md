# Embrys the Anomaly Champion Review

**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting validation and promotion to FINAL

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18

---

## 1. Champion Overview

**Name:** Embrys the Anomaly  
**Rarity:** Mythic  
**Affinity:** Force  
**Faction:** Knights Revenant  
**Role:** Support (Base Form - Debuff/Control Specialist), HP Damage Dealer (Alternate Form)

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Embrys has **TWO FORMS** with completely different skill sets. He can transform between forms using Metamorph skill (4-turn cooldown).

**Primary Use Cases:**
- **Arena (Classic Gold 3+)** (Priority 4): Stone Skin removal, buff conversion, Mythic suppression (Loki synergy)
- **Live Arena** (Priority 4): Base Form for control, Alternate Form for HP swap cheese
- **Doom Tower Hard** (Priority 3): Necrosis stacking for boss damage, True Fear for wave control
- **Clan Boss UNM** (Priority 1): Necrosis damage over time (experimental, not meta)

---

## 2. Content-Specific Ratings (X/10 Contextualized)

**Validation Note:** Ratings compare Embrys to owned champions with similar mechanics (Buff Conversion, Fear, Necrosis, HP Swap, Block Revive, Revive on Death).

### Priority 1: Clan Boss UNM
**Rating: 6/10 - Experimental Necrosis damage, not meta for sustain teams**

**Context:** Embrys' Necrosis mechanic is unique but NOT optimized for Clan Boss UNM compared to traditional HP Burn or Poison teams.

**Key Issues:**
- Necrosis does NOT stack on bosses (passive only triggers on non-boss enemy deaths)
- Base Form A1 (Fetid Glaive) destroys MAX HP (3% per hit, caps at 30%) but minimal direct damage
- Alternate Form has NO sustain, debuffs, or support for team
- **Better owned options:** Brogni (Infinity Shield), Artak (HP Burn + Decrease ATK), Ninja (HP Burn + Freeze)

**When Embrys is useful:**
- ONLY if experimenting with Necrosis + Destroy MAX HP cheese (not recommended)

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + HellHades (2/2 sources agree Embrys is NOT Clan Boss meta)

---

### Priority 2: Dungeons (Dragon 25, Spider 25, Fire Knight 25, Ice Golem 25)
**Rating: 7/10 - Decent for wave control and boss damage, but not best-in-slot**

**Context:** Embrys provides wave control (True Fear, Decrease ATK) and boss damage (Necrosis, Destroy MAX HP) but lacks speed and efficiency compared to specialized nukers.

**Dragon 25:**
- **7/10**: Base Form A2 (True Fear + Decrease ATK) controls waves
- Base Form A1 (Destroy MAX HP + Debuff Extension) helps with boss
- **Owned champions with faster clears:** Wukong, Ithos, Ninja (AOE nuke or HP Burn)

**Spider 25:**
- **7/10**: Base Form A2 (True Fear) controls spiderlings
- Alternate Form A1 (extra hit vs Necrosis targets) helps clear spiderlings IF they have Necrosis
- **Owned champions with faster clears:** Drexthar (Passive HP Burn), Triple Coldheart + Ally Attack

**Fire Knight 25:**
- **6/10**: Base Form A1 (AOE) hits shield but slow clear time
- Alternate Form A2 (double damage vs low ACC targets) useful for boss, but requires low ACC build
- **Owned champions with faster clears:** Ninja (4-hit A1), Alure (TM control)

**Ice Golem 25:**
- **7/10**: Base Form A2 (Decrease ATK) reduces Ice Golem damage
- Alternate Form A3 (HP Swap) can cheese boss if timed correctly
- **Owned champions with faster clears:** Wukong, Ithos (wave clear speed)

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + HellHades (2/2 sources agree)

---

### Priority 3: Doom Tower Hard
**Rating: 8/10 - Excellent for Necrosis stacking and True Fear control, but requires careful team building**

**Context:** Embrys' Necrosis stacking (5% MAX HP damage per stack, stacks on enemy death) and True Fear make him strong for Doom Tower Hard bosses and wave floors.

**Key Strengths:**
- Base Form Passive (Wrongful Existence): Places Necrosis on all enemies when one dies, activates Necrosis at start AND end of Embrys' turn (double proc)
- Base Form A2 (True Fear + Decrease ATK) controls waves
- Base Form A3 (The Unmaking): Removes Stone Skin, converts buffs to debuffs, steals TM
- Alternate Form A3 (HP Swap): Can cheese bosses with high HP

**Validated Comparison:**
- **No other owned champion** provides Necrosis mechanic (unique to Embrys)
- **True Fear comparison:** Scyl (1-turn Stun, not Fear), Loki (2-turn Sleep, not Fear), Wukong (Sheep, similar to Fear)
- **Buff Conversion comparison:** Loki (buff removal, not conversion), Wukong (buff strip), Embrys UNIQUE for buff-to-debuff conversion

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + HellHades (2/2 sources agree)

---

### Priority 4: Arena (Classic Gold 3+, Tag Team Bronze 3+)
**Rating: 10/10 - Best Stone Skin removal and buff conversion champion in your roster**

**Context:** Embrys' Base Form A3 (The Unmaking) is GAME-CHANGING for Arena - removes Stone Skin without requiring Accuracy (unless weak hit), converts all buffs to debuffs.

**Key Strengths (Arena):**
- **Stone Skin removal:** A3 removes Stone Skin and replaces with True Fear (does NOT require Accuracy unless weak hit - huge advantage vs high Resist teams)
- **Buff conversion:** A3 converts all stat buffs to mirrored debuffs (Increase ATK → Decrease ATK, Continuous Heal → Heal Reduction, etc.)
- **True Fear:** A2 places True Fear on all enemies for 1 turn (cannot attack or use skills)
- **Extra Turn:** A2 grants Extra Turn after placing True Fear (enables A3 combo immediately)

**Arena Offense:**
- **10/10**: Embrys counters Stone Skin meta in Gold 3+
- Combo: A2 (True Fear + Extra Turn) → A3 (Remove Stone Skin + Convert Buffs + Steal TM)
- Synergy with Loki (suppresses Mythics and active skills), Wukong (nuker), Mythrala (Hex damage)

**Arena Defense:**
- **8/10**: Base Form A3 punishes buff-heavy teams, but AI may use Metamorph poorly
- Alternate Form Passive (Revive on Death + Reflect Damage) makes Embrys hard to kill

**Validated Comparison:**
- **Stone Skin removal:** No other owned champion removes Stone Skin without Accuracy requirement
- **Buff conversion:** Embrys UNIQUE (no other owned champion converts buffs to debuffs)
- **True Fear:** Embrys (1-turn AOE), no other owned champion provides True Fear

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + HellHades + User team composition (Wukong, Mythrala, Loki, Embrys confirmed synergy)

---

### Priority 5: Faction Wars (Knights Revenant)
**Rating: 9/10 - Excellent for Knights Revenant Faction Wars, near-completion faction**

**Context:** Knights Revenant is a near-completion faction for user (Priority High). Embrys provides wave control, debuff spread, and Necrosis damage.

**Owned Knights Revenant Champions:** Embrys, Deacon Armstrong, Ghostborn, Iudex Artor, Juliana, Lady Annabelle, Pain Keeper (x3), Rector Drath (x2), Skeletor

**Key Strengths:**
- Base Form A2 (True Fear + Decrease ATK) controls waves
- Base Form A1 (Debuff Extension) extends Pain Keeper or Rector Drath debuffs
- Alternate Form A3 (HP Swap) can cheese boss stages
- Passive (Necrosis on enemy death) adds consistent damage

**Validated Comparison:**
- Embrys (9/10): Best control champion for Knights Revenant (True Fear, Buff Conversion, Necrosis)
- Rector Drath (9/10): Best support (Revive, Heal, Ally Protection)
- Skeletor (8/10): Excellent debuffer (Decrease DEF, Weaken, Leech)
- Deacon Armstrong (8/10): Speed Aura + Decrease DEF + Turn Meter control

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + owned champion list

- Increases duration of 1 random debuff on all enemies by 1 turn
- **Effect cannot be resisted if enemies have Necrosis stacks**
- Multiplier: 0.19 HP

**Notes:**
- Very low damage multiplier (0.19 HP) - not a damage skill
- Destroy MAX HP (3% per hit, 30% cap) useful for high-HP bosses
- Debuff Extension synergizes with team debuffers (Pain Keeper, Rector Drath, Skeletor)

#### A2 - Voidstare (5→4 turn CD, True Fear, Decrease ATK, Extra Turn)
- Places **True Fear** debuff on all enemies for 1 turn
- Places 50% Decrease ATK debuff on all enemies for 2 turns
- **Effects cannot be resisted if enemies have Necrosis stacks**
- **Grants Extra Turn**
- Cooldown: 5 turns → 4 turns (booked)

**Notes:**
- **SIGNATURE SKILL (Base Form):** True Fear is unique (only Embryos provides this in your roster)
- Extra Turn enables combo: A2 (True Fear) → A3 (Stone Skin removal + Buff Conversion)
- Decrease ATK (50%, 2 turns) reduces enemy damage

#### A3 - The Unmaking (5→4 turn CD, Stone Skin Removal, Buff Conversion, TM Control)
- Attacks all enemies
- **Removes Stone Skin buffs and replaces with True Fear debuffs**
- **Converts Block Debuffs to Block Buffs debuffs**

- Decreases enemy Turn Meter by 20%
- **Effects cannot be resisted if enemies have Necrosis stacks**
- Cooldown: 5 turns → 4 turns (booked)
- Multiplier: 0.27 HP

**Notes:**
- **GAME-CHANGING for Arena:** Removes Stone Skin WITHOUT requiring Accuracy (unless weak hit)
- Buff Conversion is unique to Embrys (no other owned champion does this)
- TM steal (5% per buff) + TM reduction (20%) enables turn cycling

#### Passive - Wrongful Existence (Necrosis, Double Activation)
- Whenever an enemy is killed, places one **Necrosis** stack on all other enemies
- Necrosis stacks cannot be resisted or blocked
- Necrosis stacks can only be removed by reviving dead allies
- **Does NOT work against Bosses and their minions**
- If multiple champions have this skill, only one activates
- **At START and END of Embrys' turn, instantly activates all Necrosis stacks on all enemies**

**Notes:**
- Necrosis: 5% MAX HP damage per stack (no cap)
- Double activation (start + end of turn) means 10% MAX HP damage per Necrosis stack per Embrys turn
- Does NOT work vs Clan Boss (no minions to kill)

---

### ALTERNATE FORM (2nd Form) - HP Damage Dealer

#### A1 - Unmaker's Blade (Single-Target, Extra Hit, Block Revive)
- Attacks 1 enemy
- **Places extra hit if target has Necrosis stacks**
- Places Block Revive debuff if this attack kills an enemy
- Multiplier: (0.25 + ACC/10000) HP

**Notes:**
- Scales with Accuracy (but build LOW Accuracy for A2 Ignore DEF mechanic)
- Extra hit vs Necrosis targets useful for clearing waves
- Block Revive prevents enemy revives (useful in Arena, Doom Tower)

#### A2 - Atomize (4→3 turn CD, Accuracy-Based Damage)
- Attacks all enemies
- **Deals DOUBLE damage to enemies with LOWER Accuracy than Embrys**
- **Ignores 50% DEF on enemies with EQUAL or HIGHER Accuracy than Embrys**
- Cooldown: 4 turns → 3 turns (booked)
- Multiplier: (0.28 + ACC/10000) HP

**Notes:**
- **Build Strategy:** LOW Accuracy build preferred (triggers Ignore DEF on A2 instead of double damage)
- Ignore DEF (50%) is better than double damage for high-DEF targets
- Scales with Accuracy in damage multiplier (but prioritize HP/C.DMG over Accuracy)

#### A3 - Your Life Is Forfeit! (5→4 turn CD, HP Swap, Ignore DEF Stacking)
- **Swaps HP with an enemy**
- **If target is Boss: Fully restores Embrys' destroyed MAX HP and fully heals instead**
- Increases Embrys' Ignore DEF effect by 10% while in Alternate Form (stacks up to 50%)
- **Grants Extra Turn**
- Cooldown: 5 turns → 4 turns (booked)

**Notes:**
- **HP Swap cheese:** Can one-shot enemy with high HP, or survive with low HP by swapping with high-HP enemy
- **Boss mechanic:** vs Bosses, fully heals Embrys instead of swapping (useful for sustain)
- **Ignore DEF stacking:** Each use adds +10% Ignore DEF (caps at 50%, permanent in Alternate Form)
- Extra Turn enables combo: A3 (HP Swap) → A2 (Atomize with stacked Ignore DEF)

#### Passive - Degenerator (Reflect Damage, Necrosis, Revive on Death)
- **[Passive Effect - When Dies]:** Reflects 50% of fatal hit damage (including surplus damage) back to attacker
- Whenever an enemy is killed, places one Necrosis stack on all other enemies (same as Base Form)
- **[Active Effect - Revive on Death]:** If Embrys is about to die, preempts fatal hit and places Revive On Death buff for 1 turn BEFORE damage taken
- Cooldown: 5 turns (for Revive on Death)

**Notes:**
- **Revive on Death:** Embrys cheats death once per 5 turns (places buff BEFORE damage, so buff is active when fatal hit lands)
- **Reflect Damage:** 50% of fatal hit + surplus damage reflected (can kill attacker if they one-shot Embrys)
- Necrosis on enemy death (same as Base Form)

---

### COMMON SKILL (Both Forms)

#### Metamorph (4 turn CD, Form Transformation)
- Transforms Embrys into Base/Alternate Form
- **Grants Extra Turn**
- Cooldown: 4 turns

**Notes:**
- Use Metamorph strategically (Base Form for control/Arena, Alternate Form for damage/cheese)
- Extra Turn enables immediate action in new form

#### Aura - Increase Ally HP in All Battles by 35%

## 6. Faction Wars Advice

- **Notes:** Requires careful speed tuning, enables permanent uptime on key skills

**Gaps:**
- No strong AOE nuker (wave clear slow)
- Faction near completion (Normal stages), focus on Hard stages

### Ideal 5-Champion Pull List (Non-Owned Only)

5. **Crimson Helm** (Epic, Void)
   - **Rationale:** AOE Provoke + Ally Protection
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM - Tank/control
   - **Priority:** Pull FIFTH

   - **Different:** No True Fear, no Buff Conversion, no Stone Skin removal
   - **When to use Loki instead:** When Mythic/active skill suppression is needed (Loki UNIQUE)

2. **Sun Wukong (9/10 for Arena):**
   - **Similar:** Buff Strip, Sheep (similar to True Fear), Speed Aura
   - **Different:** No Buff Conversion, no Stone Skin removal without Accuracy
   - **When to use Wukong instead:** When Speed Aura + raw nuke damage is needed

3. **Scyl of the Drakes (8/10 for sustain):**
   - **Similar:** Stun (1 turn, similar to True Fear), Revive, Heal
   - **Different:** Stun (not Fear), no Buff Conversion, no Stone Skin removal
   - **When to use Scyl instead:** When Revive + sustain is critical

**Summary:** Embrys is best-in-class for Stone Skin removal and Buff Conversion (UNIQUE in your roster). No other owned champion can remove Stone Skin without Accuracy requirement.

## 8. Investment Recommendations

### Priority Level: **HIGH** (Top 10 champions in roster)

**Rationale:**
- Embrys is GAME-CHANGING for Arena (Stone Skin removal meta in Gold 3+)
- Embrys is excellent for Doom Tower Hard (Necrosis stacking, True Fear control)
- Embrys is essential for Knights Revenant Faction Wars (near-completion faction, Priority High)
- Embrys is MYTHIC (hard to obtain, significant investment)

### Investment Order:

**Step 1: Level to 60, Full Ascension (6 stars)**
- Required for Arena Gold 3+ and Doom Tower Hard

**Step 2: Full Skill Books (11 total - Mythic books expensive!)**
- **Priority Order:** Base Form A3 → Base Form A2 → Alternate Form A3 → Alternate Form A2
- **Base Form A3 (3 books):** -1 turn cooldown (5 → 4 turns) - CRITICAL for Arena Stone Skin removal
- **Base Form A2 (3 books):** -1 turn cooldown (5 → 4 turns) + increased debuff chance
- **Alternate Form A3 (2 books):** -1 turn cooldown (5 → 4 turns)
- **Alternate Form A2 (2 books):** -1 turn cooldown (4 → 3 turns)
- **A1 (1 book):** Damage increase (low priority)

**Step 3: Full Masteries (Helmsmasher for both forms)**
- **CRITICAL:** Helmsmasher (T6 Offense) for Ignore DEF (Base Form A3, Alternate Form all skills)

**Step 4: Optimal Gear (80k+ HP, 260+ SPD, 200+ ACC for Base Form)**
- Focus on HP% chest/gloves for HP-based damage
- Speed boots mandatory for Arena
- Accuracy banner for Base Form (debuffs)

### When to Stop Investment:

**Base Form (Arena/Control):** MUST be fully invested (60, 6-star, full books, full masteries, optimal gear) for Arena Gold 3+

**Alternate Form (Damage/Cheese):** Can stop at partial investment if ONLY using Base Form for Arena

**PVE Disclaimer:** This champion requires full booking (expensive Mythic books!) and optimal gear (80k+ HP, 260+ SPD, 200+ ACC) for optimal performance in Arena and Doom Tower Hard.

## 10. Cheese Strategy Integration

### Cheese Strategy 1: Stone Skin Removal + Buff Conversion (Arena)

**Cheese Type:** Stone Skin removal WITHOUT Accuracy requirement

**Required Champions:**
- Embrys the Anomaly (Base Form A3: The Unmaking)
- Any nuker (Wukong, Ithos, Ninja, etc.)

**Cheese Viability:** CRITICAL (best Stone Skin counter in Arena)

**Safety Level:** SAFE (consistent, reliable, only fails on weak hit due to affinity)

**Content Applications:** Arena (Classic, Live, Tag Team)

**Setup Requirements:**
- Embrys goes FIRST or SECOND (after buffer/TM booster)
- Combo: Embrys A2 (True Fear + Extra Turn) → Embrys A3 (Remove Stone Skin) → Nuker finishes

**Expected Results:**
- Success rate: 90%+ (only fails if Embrys weak hits vs Spirit enemies)
- Enables wins vs Stone Skin meta teams

---

### Cheese Strategy 2: HP Swap Boss Cheese (Doom Tower, Dungeons)

**Cheese Type:** HP Swap to one-shot high-HP bosses or survive with low HP

**Required Champions:**
- Embrys the Anomaly (Alternate Form A3: Your Life Is Forfeit!)
- Sustain/Revive champions (Rector Drath, Godseeker Aniri, Scyl)

**Cheese Viability:** HIGH (works on non-boss-immune mechanics)

**Safety Level:** RISKY (requires timing, Embrys must survive to use A3)

**Content Applications:** Doom Tower Hard bosses, Dungeon bosses, Live Arena

**Setup Requirements:**
- Embrys in Alternate Form
- Embrys survives to low HP (10-20%)
- Use A3 to swap HP with high-HP enemy or boss

**Expected Results:**
- One-shot: If swapping with high-HP enemy at full HP
- Survival: If swapping low HP Embrys with high-HP enemy
- Success rate: 60-70% (depends on timing and RNG)

---

### Cheese Strategy 3: Necrosis Stacking (Doom Tower Waves)

**Cheese Type:** Stack Necrosis debuffs by killing enemies, deal massive MAX HP damage

**Required Champions:**
- Embrys the Anomaly (Base Form Passive: Wrongful Existence)
- AOE nukers or multi-hitters (Wukong, Ithos, Ninja)

**Cheese Viability:** MEDIUM (requires killing enemies to stack Necrosis)

**Safety Level:** SAFE (consistent damage once Necrosis stacks)

**Content Applications:** Doom Tower Hard waves, Faction Wars waves

**Setup Requirements:**
- Kill one enemy → Necrosis placed on all others (5% MAX HP per stack)
