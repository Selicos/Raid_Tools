## Content-Specific Ratings (X/10 Contextualized to Owned Champions)

### Priority 2: Dungeons (10/10) ⭐ BEST-IN-CLASS

**Rating:** 10/10 - **BEST MAX HP damage champion in your roster for Dungeons (Fire Knight, Spider, Dragon, Ice Golem)**

**Why 10/10:**
- **Heartseeker (A3):** 0.1 Enemy MAX HP damage + 100% TM depletion + 30% extra Crit Rate (70% Crit Rate = 100% Crit on A3)
- **Fire Knight 25:** A1 (4 hits) breaks shield instantly, A3 nukes boss for massive damage
- **Spider 25:** A3 nukes Spider boss (10% MAX HP = millions of damage), 100% TM depletion prevents Spider from taking turns
- **Dragon 25:** A3 nukes boss for massive damage, A1 (4 hits) applies Heal Reduction (prevents boss self-heal)
- **Ice Golem 25:** A3 nukes boss, A1 Heal Reduction prevents passive healing
- **Validated best owned champion:** No other owned champion can deal 10% Enemy MAX HP damage per hit (Coldheart, Royal Guard, Sethalia are top tier, user owns Coldheart)

**Comparison to Other Owned Champions:**
- **Geomancer (10/10 CB, 8/10 Dungeons):** Excellent Reflect Damage for bosses, but Coldheart's Heartseeker deals instant MAX HP damage (faster boss kills)
- **Ninja (9/10 Dungeons):** Freeze + HP Burn + MAX HP damage (A3), but Coldheart's TM control + 0.1 MAX HP damage is superior for speed runs
- **Artak (9/10 Dungeons):** HP Burn for sustained damage, but Coldheart's burst MAX HP damage is faster
- **Michelangelo (8/10 Dungeons):** Debuff spread + Taunt control, but no MAX HP damage → Coldheart superior for boss nuking

**Team Synergies:**
- **Best Dungeon Team:** Coldheart (MAX HP damage), Geomancer (Reflect Damage), Tayrel (Dec DEF), Deacon Armstrong (Dec DEF + TM boost), Speed lead
- **Coldheart role:** Break Fire Knight shield (A1 4 hits), nuke boss (A3 Heartseeker), control TM (100% TM depletion)
- **Triple Coldheart Cheese:** 3x Coldheart + Ally Attack (Nogdar, Longbeard) + speed lead = instant boss kill (A3 x3 = 30% Enemy MAX HP damage)

---

### Priority 1: Clan Boss UNM (7/10) ⭐ GOOD (Limited by 10% MAX HP Cap)

**Rating:** 7/10 - **Good for Clan Boss UNM, but limited by 10% MAX HP damage cap per hit**

**Why 7/10:**
- **Heartseeker (A3):** 0.1 Enemy MAX HP damage (capped at 10% per hit on bosses → 75k damage max per hit on CB UNM with 75M HP)
- **Giant Slayer mastery:** A1 (4 hits) triggers Giant Slayer 30% x4 = high proc rate → 7.5% Clan Boss MAX HP per proc (562k damage per proc on CB UNM)
- **Heal Reduction:** A1 (4 hits) applies 100% Heal Reduction (prevents Clan Boss self-heal, useful for some affinity rotations)
- **Not 8-9/10:** Outclassed by champions with consistent damage (Geomancer, Frozen Banshee Poison, Skullcrusher Counterattack teams)
- **Not 10/10:** Heartseeker (A3) damage capped at 75k per hit → Giant Slayer procs deal more damage (562k per proc)

**Comparison to Other Owned Champions:**
- **Geomancer (10/10 CB UNM):** Reflect Damage (uncapped) + HP Burn → 15-20M damage per run (best CB UNM champion)
- **Frozen Banshee (9/10 CB UNM):** Poison damage (10x stacks, 50k per tick, 500k per turn) → 10-15M damage per run
- **Skullcrusher (10/10 CB UNM):** Counterattack (doubles team damage) → enables 2-3 key UNM
- **Coldheart (7/10 CB UNM):** MAX HP damage capped at 75k per hit, but Giant Slayer procs are strong (562k per proc)

**User-Specific Notes:**
- User has well-built HP Burn teams (Artak, Ninja, Geomancer) → Coldheart not needed for CB UNM
- User's CB UNM team: Skullcrusher, Geomancer, Frozen Banshee, Tayrel, Vogoth → Coldheart is backup option

### Priority 3: Doom Tower Hard (9/10) ⭐ EXCELLENT

**Rating:** 9/10 - **Excellent for Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms + boss nuking, but weak for Bommal/Scarab/Nether Spider**

**Why 9/10:**
- **Secret Rooms (Hard):** Heartseeker (A3) nukes bosses for massive damage (10% MAX HP per hit)
- **Boss nuking:** All Doom Tower Hard bosses (except Bommal, Scarab, Nether Spider) vulnerable to MAX HP damage
- **TM control:** 100% TM depletion prevents boss from taking turns (critical for Dark Fae, Frost Spider, Celestial Griffin)
- **Heal Reduction:** A1 (4 hits) prevents boss self-healing (Dark Fae, Magma Dragon)
- **Not 10/10:** Weak for Bommal Hard (passive damage only), Scarab King Hard (shield + MAX HP damage less effective), Nether Spider Hard (AoE HP focus)

**Comparison to Other Owned Champions:**
- **Vogoth (10/10 DT Hard Bommal):** Best tank for Bommal Hard cheese, Coldheart cannot tank Bommal
- **Bad-el-Kazar (9/10 DT Hard):** Sustain for long fights, Coldheart better for burst damage (Heartseeker)
- **Geomancer (9/10 DT Hard):** Reflect Damage for Bommal/Scarab/Frost Spider, Coldheart better for Dark Fae/Celestial Griffin/Magma Dragon
- **Coldheart (9/10 DT Hard):** Best for Secret Rooms + boss nuking (except Bommal/Scarab/Nether Spider)

---

### Priority 4: Arena (6/10) ⭐ USABLE (Low Priority)

**Rating:** 6/10 - **Usable for Arena Offense, poor for Arena Defense (AI issues, squishy)**

**Why 6/10:**
- **Arena Offense (manual):** Heartseeker (A3) nukes tanky champions (Vogoth, Scyl, Duchess), 100% TM depletion prevents revive champions from taking turns
- **Heal Reduction:** A1 (4 hits) prevents healer teams from recovering (Scyl, Rector Drath, Godseeker Aniri)
- **Not 7-8/10:** Low HP/DEF (squishy, dies easily to enemy nukers), AI uses A2 first (wasted turn), user's core Arena team already strong (Wukong, Mithrala, Loki)
- **Arena Defense:** Poor AI (uses A2 first instead of A3), squishy (easy to one-shot), user does not prioritize Arena Defense

**Comparison to Other Owned Champions:**
- **Wukong (10/10 Arena):** Speed lead + buff strip + nuke + sheep → user's primary Arena nuker
- **Mithrala (9/10 Arena):** Buffs/cleanse + hex damage → user's primary Arena support
- **Loki (10/10 Arena):** Control + suppress Mythics/active skills → user's primary Arena control
- **Coldheart (6/10 Arena):** Usable for offense (MAX HP nuke + TM control), but user's core Arena team already established

**User-Specific Notes:**
- User often loses speed battle in higher Arena tiers → Coldheart's squishy nature makes her risky for Arena
- Recommended for Gold 3+ offense (manual): Coldheart vs. tanky/revive teams (nuke + TM control)

---

### Priority 5: Faction Wars (8/10) ⭐ EXCELLENT

**Rating:** 8/10 - **Core damage dealer for Dark Elves Faction Wars, critical for Stage 21 boss nuke**

**Why 8/10:**
- **Dark Elves damage dealer:** Heartseeker (A3) nukes Valkyrie boss (Stage 21), A2 (AoE) clears waves
- **Heal Reduction:** A1 (4 hits) prevents Valkyrie self-heal (Stage 21 boss)
- **TM control:** 100% TM depletion prevents Valkyrie from taking turns (Stage 21 critical)
- **Not 9-10/10:** Squishy (requires protection from Scyl/Bad-el/Vogoth), no sustain (needs healer on team)

**User's Faction Wars Progress:**
- **Dark Elves:** NOT in completed Normal list (Orc, Banner Lords, Barbarian, Dwarf) → **HIGH PRIORITY faction**
- **Coldheart is CRITICAL** for Dark Elves Stage 21 completion (boss nuke + TM control)

**Comparison to Other Owned Dark Elves Champions:**
- **Coldheart (8/10 FW):** Best damage dealer for Dark Elves, CRITICAL for Stage 21 boss nuke
- **[User to list other owned Dark Elves champions from owned list]**

## Skills & Mechanics

### A1: Flurry of Arrows (4-Hit Attack + Heal Reduction)

**Base Effect:**
- **Attacks 1 enemy 4 times**
- **25% chance** per hit to place **100% [Heal Reduction]** debuff for **2 turns**
- **Multiplier:** 0.7 ATK per hit (2.8 ATK total across 4 hits)

**Fully Booked:**
- **35% chance** per hit to place **100% [Heal Reduction]** debuff for **2 turns**
- **Books Required:** 4 Epic Books (increases Heal Reduction chance by +10%)

**Key Notes:**
- **4 hits = excellent for Fire Knight shield break** (each hit removes 1 shield segment)
- **4 hits = high Giant Slayer proc rate** (30% proc chance per hit → ~75% chance for at least 1 proc per A1 cast)
- **Heal Reduction prevents boss self-healing** (Fire Knight, Dragon, Ice Golem, Clan Boss)
- **35% Heal Reduction chance (booked) = ~79% chance to land at least 1 Heal Reduction across 4 hits**
- **Random targeting** (not ideal for wave clear, excellent for single-target bosses)

**Use Cases:**
- **Fire Knight:** Break shield (4 hits), apply Heal Reduction (prevents FK self-heal)
- **Clan Boss:** Apply Heal Reduction (prevents CB self-heal), trigger Giant Slayer (4 hits = high proc rate)
- **Doom Tower Hard:** Apply Heal Reduction (Dark Fae, Magma Dragon), trigger Giant Slayer
- **Faction Wars:** Single-target damage + Heal Reduction (Stage 21 Valkyrie boss)

---

### A2: Art of Pain (AoE Attack + Decrease ACC + Poison)

**Base Effect:**
- **Attacks all enemies**
- **30% chance** to place **50% [Decrease ACC]** debuff for **1 turn**
- **Places 5% [Poison]** debuff for **2 turns** on targets that have **[Heal Reduction]** debuff
- **Cooldown:** 4 turns

**Fully Booked:**
- **35% chance** to place **50% [Decrease ACC]** debuff for **1 turn**
- **Cooldown:** 3 turns (reduced by 1)
- **Books Required:** 4 Epic Books (increases Dec ACC chance by +5%, reduces cooldown by 1)

**Key Notes:**
- **AoE wave clear** (low multiplier 3.3 ATK, not ideal for wave clear)
- **Poison synergy with A1 Heal Reduction** (if A1 applied Heal Reduction, A2 applies 5% Poison to those targets)
- **Decrease ACC debuff** (reduces enemy accuracy, useful vs. debuff-heavy enemies)
- **AI ISSUE:** Coldheart's AI **always uses A2 first** (even when A3 would be better) → **DISABLE A2 for Spider/Fire Knight to prioritize A3**
- **Not recommended for manual play** (A3 Heartseeker is always better for boss damage)

**Use Cases:**
- **Spider (AI disabled):** Disable A2 to force Coldheart to use A3 (Heartseeker) every 4 turns → MAX HP damage focus
- **Fire Knight (AI disabled):** Disable A2 to force A3 (Heartseeker) → MAX HP damage focus
- **Wave clear (auto):** A2 AoE can clear weak waves, but low multiplier limits effectiveness
- **Poison damage:** If A1 applied Heal Reduction, A2 applies 5% Poison (extra damage over time)

**Community Recommendation:**
- **Disable A2 for Spider/Fire Knight** (force A3 Heartseeker every 4 turns)
- **Enable A2 for Dragon/Ice Golem** (AoE wave clear + Poison damage)
- **Disable A2 for Doom Tower Hard** (prioritize A3 Heartseeker for boss nuking)

---

### A3: Heartseeker (MAX HP Damage + Turn Meter Depletion + 30% Crit Bonus)

**Base Effect:**
- **Attacks 1 enemy**
- **Damage increases according to target's MAX HP** (0.1 Enemy MAX HP = 10% Enemy MAX HP damage per hit)
- **Places 100% [Decrease Turn Meter]** debuff (depletes Turn Meter by 100%)
- **This skill has a 30% increased chance of inflicting a CRITICAL HIT**
- **Cooldown:** 5 turns

**Fully Booked:**
- **Cooldown:** 4 turns (reduced by 1)
- **Books Required:** 4 Epic Books (reduces cooldown by 1)

**Multiplier:**
- **1.7 ATK + 0.1 Enemy MAX HP**
- **Example (Spider 25 boss, 5M HP):** 1.7 x 3,000 ATK + 0.1 x 5,000,000 = 5,100 + 500,000 = **505,100 damage per hit** (BEFORE Crit Damage multiplier)
- **With 200% Crit Damage:** 505,100 x 3.0 = **1,515,300 damage per hit** (ONE-SHOT Spider waves)

**Key Notes:**
- **30% increased Crit Rate** = If Coldheart has **70% Crit Rate** from gear, A3 has **100% Crit Rate** (guaranteed Crit on Heartseeker)
- **Turn Meter depletion changed from "Fully deplete" to "100% reduction"** (Plarium nerf):
  * **Old:** Fully depleted Turn Meter (set to 0%, regardless of current TM)
  * **New:** Reduces Turn Meter by 100% (if Spider has 150% TM from Spiderlings, TM becomes 50% after Heartseeker)
  * **Impact:** Spider can still take turns if Spiderlings boost TM >100% → pair with TM control (Armiger, Allure)
- **Dragon 25 nerf (Apr 2024):** Dragon immune to Turn Meter reduction → Coldheart's A3 still deals MAX HP damage, but no TM control
- **Clan Boss MAX HP damage cap:** Heartseeker damage capped at **10% boss MAX HP per hit** → 75k damage max on CB UNM (75M HP) → Giant Slayer procs deal more damage (562k per proc)

**Use Cases:**
- **Spider 25:** A3 nukes Spider boss (10% MAX HP = 500k+ damage), depletes TM (prevents Spider from taking turns)
- **Fire Knight 25:** A3 nukes FK boss (10% MAX HP = massive damage), depletes TM (prevents FK from taking turns)
- **Dragon 25:** A3 nukes Dragon boss (10% MAX HP), but no TM control (Dragon immune to TM reduction)
- **Ice Golem 25:** A3 nukes IG boss (10% MAX HP), depletes TM (prevents IG from taking turns)
- **Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms:** A3 nukes all bosses (10% MAX HP per hit)
- **Clan Boss UNM:** A3 deals 75k damage (capped at 10% boss MAX HP) → Giant Slayer procs better (562k per proc)

**Community Validation:**
- **Mcgrave (Feb 2025):** "100 procent Crit rate not needed, 70 is enough with her Hearts zeker attack" → Confirms A3 +30% Crit bonus
- **LostUser75 (Apr 2024):** "Dragon rating should be lowered to 4, Plarium made him immune to turn reduction" → Dragon immune to TM reduction (nerf confirmed)
- **ASH video (2022):** "Coldheart Best Builds To Use in 2022 (Reflex Heartseeker)" → Reflex set reduces A3 cooldown (4 turns → 3 turns with Reflex proc)
- **NewOnBoard (Feb 2022):** "I put her in Reflex Set with Speed and Acc + A2 deactivated. Paired with Allure (only A1 activated)... Fireknight has no chance at all" → Reflex + disable A2 strategy confirmed

## Skill Booking Priority

**Booking Recommendation:** **BOOK A3 FIRST (CRITICAL), then A1 (HIGH), skip A2 (LOW)**

**Priority Breakdown:**

1. **A3 Heartseeker (CRITICAL - 4 Epic Books):**
   - Reduces cooldown from 5 turns → 4 turns (20% faster MAX HP damage)
   - **Impact:** Dungeons clear time reduced by 10-20%, Doom Tower Hard boss kills faster
   - **Cost:** 4 Epic Books
   - **MUST BOOK:** A3 cooldown reduction is CRITICAL for Coldheart's effectiveness

2. **A1 Flurry of Arrows (HIGH - 4 Epic Books):**
   - Increases Heal Reduction chance from 25% → 35% (+10%)
   - **Impact:** ~79% chance to land at least 1 Heal Reduction across 4 hits (vs. ~68% unbooked) → 11% improvement
   - **Cost:** 4 Epic Books
   - **RECOMMENDED:** Book A1 for Fire Knight, Dragon, Ice Golem (Heal Reduction prevents boss self-heal)

3. **A2 Art of Pain (LOW - 4 Epic Books):**
   - Increases Dec ACC chance from 30% → 35% (+5%), reduces cooldown from 4 turns → 3 turns
   - **Impact:** Minimal (A2 disabled for Spider/Fire Knight, low priority for Dragon/Ice Golem)
   - **Cost:** 4 Epic Books
   - **SKIP:** A2 is disabled for most optimal Coldheart strategies (Spider/Fire Knight)

**Total Books Required:**
- **Minimum (A3 only):** 4 Epic Books → Coldheart functional for Dungeons/Doom Tower Hard
- **Recommended (A3 + A1):** 8 Epic Books → Coldheart optimal for all content
- **Full (A3 + A1 + A2):** 12 Epic Books → Not recommended (A2 low priority, often disabled)

**Partial Investment Guidance:**
- **Budget option:** Book A3 only (4 books) → Coldheart still excellent for Spider/Fire Knight (A3 cooldown reduction critical)
- **Mid-tier option:** Book A3 + partial A1 (6-8 books) → Improved Heal Reduction chance for Fire Knight/Dragon
- **Full investment:** Book A3 + A1 (8 books) → Skip A2 (disabled for optimal strategies)

## Gear Recommendations

### Stat Priority Summary

**CRITICAL Stats (Non-Negotiable):**
1. **70-100% Crit Rate** (70% minimum for A3 Heartseeker +30% bonus = 100% Crit on A3)
2. **150-300% Crit Damage** (200%+ recommended for MAX HP damage scaling)
3. **200-225+ Accuracy** (200 for Dungeons 25, 225+ for Doom Tower Hard)
4. **180-220+ Speed** (180 minimum for Dungeons auto, 220+ for speed nuke teams)

**IMPORTANT Stats (Survivability):**
5. **30,000-40,000+ HP** (Coldheart has very low base HP → requires HP% gloves/chest OR Shield buffs)
6. **2,000-2,500+ DEF** (Coldheart has very low base DEF → requires DEF% substats OR crowd control)

**Formula for A3 Heartseeker Damage:**
```
Base Damage = (1.7 x ATK) + (0.1 x Enemy MAX HP)
Crit Damage = Base Damage x (1 + Crit Damage%)
Final Damage = Crit Damage x (1 + DEF penetration) x (1 - Enemy DEF reduction)

Example (Spider 25, 3,000 ATK, 200% Crit Damage, 10% Enemy MAX HP):
Base = (1.7 x 3,000) + (0.1 x 5,000,000) = 5,100 + 500,000 = 505,100
Crit = 505,100 x 3.0 = 1,515,300 damage per hit
```

**Gear Sets:**
- **Critical Damage (4-piece):** +40% Crit Damage
- **Accuracy (2-piece):** +40 Accuracy
- **Alternative:** Critical Damage + Perception (40 ACC + 8% stats) OR Critical Damage + Speed (12% SPD)

**Artifact Stats:**
- **Weapon:** ATK (flat, cannot change) + SPD/ACC/Crit Rate/HP substats
- **Helmet:** HP (flat, cannot change) + SPD/ACC/Crit Rate/DEF substats
- **Shield:** DEF (flat, cannot change) + SPD/ACC/Crit Rate/HP substats

- **Amulet:** **Crit Damage** (flat) + SPD/ACC/Crit Rate/HP substats
- **Banner:** **Accuracy** (flat) + SPD/Crit Rate/HP/DEF substats

**Target Stats:**

**Use Cases:**
- **Best for:** All Dungeons (Dragon, Spider, Fire Knight, Ice Golem), Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms, Clan Boss UNM
- **Strengths:** Balanced stats (damage + survivability + accuracy), works on auto
- **Weaknesses:** Requires high-quality gear (Crit Rate + Crit Damage + ACC + SPD + HP/DEF substats)

---

### Build Option 2: Reflex Focus (Spider/Fire Knight Speed Nuke) ⭐ SPEED META

**Gear Sets:**
- **Reflex (4-piece):** +18% chance to reset random skill cooldown when using a skill
- **Speed (2-piece):** +12% Speed

**Use Cases:**
- **Best for:** Spider 25 speed nuke (A3 every 3-4 turns with Reflex procs), Fire Knight 25 speed nuke
- **Strengths:** Reflex procs reset A3 Heartseeker cooldown (18% chance per skill cast = ~50% chance to reset A3 across 3 skill casts) → more MAX HP damage per run
- **Weaknesses:** Requires disabling A2 (force A3 priority), lower survivability (HP/DEF sacrificed for damage), RNG-dependent (Reflex procs not guaranteed)

**Community Validation:**
- **ASH video (2022):** "Coldheart Best Builds To Use in 2022 (Reflex Heartseeker)" → Reflex set confirmed optimal for Spider/FK speed nuke
- **NewOnBoard (Feb 2022):** "I put her in Reflex Set with Speed and Acc + A2 deactivated. Paired with Allure (only A1 activated)... Fireknight has no chance at all" → Reflex + disable A2 strategy confirmed

---

**Gear Sets:**
- **Savage (4-piece):** Ignores 25% of target's DEF

- **Alternative:** Savage + Critical Damage (40% Crit Damage) OR Savage + Speed (12% SPD)

**Artifact Stats:**
- **Gloves:** **Crit Damage%** (primary)
- **Chest:** **ATK%** (primary)
- **Boots:** **Speed** (primary)

- **180-220 Speed**
- **25,000-35,000 HP** (lower priority)
- **1,800-2,200 DEF** (lower priority)

**Use Cases:**
- **Best for:** Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms (bosses with high DEF), Dragon 25 (boss with high DEF), Ice Golem 25 (boss with high DEF)
- **Strengths:** Savage ignores 25% DEF → 33% damage increase vs. high-DEF bosses, highest damage potential for A3 Heartseeker
- **Weaknesses:** Savage gear is end-game (Doom Tower Normal/Hard drops only), lower survivability (HP/DEF sacrificed for damage)

---

### Build Option 4: Perception Focus (High Accuracy + Stats) ⭐ BUDGET OPTION

**Gear Sets:**
- **Perception (3x 2-piece):** +120 Accuracy + 24% all stats (HP, ATK, DEF, SPD)
- **Alternative:** Perception x2 + Speed (80 ACC + 16% stats + 12% SPD)

**Artifact Stats:**
- **Gloves:** **Crit Rate%** (primary) OR **Crit Damage%** (if Crit Rate from substats)
- **Chest:** **ATK%** (primary) OR **HP%** (survivability)
- **Boots:** **Speed** (primary)
- **Amulet:** **Crit Damage** (flat)
- **Banner:** **Accuracy** (flat)

**Target Stats:**
- **70-100% Crit Rate** (70% minimum)
- **150-250% Crit Damage** (200%+ optimal)
- **225-275 Accuracy** (Perception sets provide +120 ACC)
- **180-220 Speed** (Perception provides +24% SPD from 24% all stats bonus)
- **30,000-40,000 HP** (Perception provides +24% HP from 24% all stats bonus)
- **2,000-2,500 DEF** (Perception provides +24% DEF from 24% all stats bonus)

**Use Cases:**
- **Best for:** Budget builds (Perception farmable from Dungeons), Doom Tower Hard (high accuracy requirement 225+), early-game Coldheart
- **Strengths:** Easy to farm (Dragon, Spider, Fire Knight, Ice Golem all drop Perception), provides balanced stats (ACC + HP + DEF + SPD + ATK)
- **Weaknesses:** Lower Crit Damage than Critical Damage sets (need Crit Damage from substats)

---

### Build Option 5: Lifesteal Focus (Survivability) ⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Gear Sets:**
- **Lifesteal (4-piece):** +30% of damage dealt returned as HP
- **Speed (2-piece):** +12% Speed

**Why NOT Recommended:**
- **Coldheart's A3 Heartseeker deals MAX HP damage** → Lifesteal returns 30% of damage as HP → potential to heal 150k+ HP per A3 cast
- **HOWEVER:** Coldheart has very low base HP/DEF → dies before A3 cast in most scenarios
- **Better alternatives:** Use Shield buffs (Skullcrusher, Lodric Falconheart), crowd control (Stun/Provoke/Freeze), OR speed nuke teams (kill enemy before they act)

**Only Use If:**
- User has no Shield champions, no crowd control champions, AND Coldheart dies frequently in Dungeons
- User is early-game and cannot farm better gear sets

### Detailed Artifact Recommendations

**Banner (ALWAYS Accuracy):**
- **Primary Stat:** Accuracy (flat) → +40-60 Accuracy
- **Substats:** Speed, Crit Rate, HP%, DEF%
- **Why Accuracy:** Coldheart needs 200-225+ Accuracy for Dungeons 25/DT Hard → Banner provides largest Accuracy boost (40-60 flat)

**Chest (ATK% or HP% Depending on Survivability):**
- **Primary Stat:** ATK% (damage focus) OR HP% (survivability focus)
- **Substats:** Speed, Accuracy, Crit Rate, DEF%
- **When to use HP%:** If Coldheart dies frequently in Dungeons/DT Hard (use HP% chest + Shield buffs)
- **When to use ATK%:** If Coldheart survives long enough to cast A3 (use ATK% chest for maximum damage)

**Boots (ALWAYS Speed):**
- **Primary Stat:** Speed (flat) → +40-50 Speed
- **Substats:** Accuracy, Crit Rate, HP%, DEF%
- **Why Speed:** Coldheart needs 180-220+ Speed for Dungeons 25/DT Hard → Boots provide largest Speed boost (40-50 flat)

**Gloves (Crit Damage% or Crit Rate% Depending on Crit Rate):**
- **Primary Stat:** Crit Damage% (if 70%+ Crit Rate from substats) OR Crit Rate% (if <70% Crit Rate from substats)
- **Substats:** Speed, Accuracy, HP%, DEF%
- **When to use Crit Damage%:** If Crit Rate ≥70% from substats/sets (maximize damage)
- **When to use Crit Rate%:** If Crit Rate <70% from substats/sets (reach 70% minimum for A3 +30% = 100% Crit)

**Weapon/Helmet/Shield (Flat Stats, Focus on Substats):**
- **Primary Stats:** Cannot change (ATK flat, HP flat, DEF flat)
- **Substats (PRIORITY):** Speed, Accuracy, Crit Rate, Crit Damage, HP%, DEF%
- **Ideal substats (Weapon):** +20 Speed, +40 Accuracy, +15% Crit Rate, +10% HP
- **Ideal substats (Helmet):** +20 Speed, +40 Accuracy, +15% Crit Rate, +15% DEF
- **Ideal substats (Shield):** +20 Speed, +40 Accuracy, +15% Crit Rate, +15% HP

**Tier 1 (3 scrolls):**

**Tier 2 (6 scrolls):**
- **Charged Focus (3/3):** +20 Accuracy

- **Example (Spider 25, 500k base A3 damage):** Flawless Execution adds +100k damage per A3 cast (500k x 1.2 = 600k)
- **Helmsmasher (Tier 5) synergy:** Ignore 25% DEF + Flawless Execution +20% Crit Damage = maximum A3 Heartseeker damage
- **Lore of Steel (Tier 3) synergy:** +15% set bonus effects → Critical Damage set +40% becomes +46% (+6% Crit Damage)

**Use Cases:**
- **Best for:** All Dungeons (Dragon, Spider, Fire Knight, Ice Golem), Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms, Faction Wars
- **Strengths:** Maximum A3 Heartseeker damage in primary content, Helmsmasher ignores 25% DEF (synergy with Savage set)
- **Weaknesses:** Does not benefit Clan Boss (Flawless Execution does not work on CB)

---

### Mastery Build Option 2: Giant Slayer (Clan Boss UNM Focus) ⚠️ CONDITIONAL

**Offense Tree (70 scrolls → Tier 6 Giant Slayer):**

**Tier 1-5:** Same as Flawless Execution build above (substitute Flawless Execution path with Giant Slayer path)

**Tier 6 (22 scrolls):**
- **Giant Slayer (1/1):** 30% chance to deal 7.5% Enemy MAX HP damage when attacking (50% chance on bosses)

**Support Tree (60 scrolls → Tier 4):**
- Same as Flawless Execution build above

**Total Scrolls Required:** 130 (70 Offense + 60 Support)

**Why Giant Slayer:**
- **30% proc chance per hit (50% on bosses)** → Coldheart's A1 (4 hits) has ~93.75% chance to proc at least 1 Giant Slayer
- **7.5% Enemy MAX HP damage per proc** → Clan Boss UNM (75M HP) = 562,500 damage per proc
- **A1 (4 hits) = high proc rate** → 50% chance per hit x 4 = 2 procs expected per A1 cast = 1.125M damage per A1 cast
- **Clan Boss MAX HP damage cap:** Heartseeker (A3) capped at 75k damage per hit on CB UNM → Giant Slayer procs deal 562k per proc (7.5x more damage than A3)

**When to Use Giant Slayer:**
- **ONLY if Coldheart is used for Clan Boss UNM** (user has well-built HP Burn teams, Coldheart not needed for CB)
- **NOT recommended for Dungeons/Doom Tower Hard** (Flawless Execution +20% Crit Damage is better for A3 Heartseeker MAX HP damage)

**Community Debate:**
- **Ayumilove recommendation:** Giant Slayer (Clan Boss focus)
- **Community consensus:** Flawless Execution (Dungeons/Doom Tower Hard focus) → Coldheart is S-tier for Dungeons, not optimal for Clan Boss
- **User-specific:** User has well-built HP Burn teams (Artak, Ninja, Geomancer) → Coldheart not needed for CB UNM → **Flawless Execution RECOMMENDED**

### Mastery Comparison Table

| Mastery Build | Tier 6 Talent | Best Use Case | Dungeons Damage | CB UNM Damage | Recommendation |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Flawless Execution** | +20% Crit Damage (Dungeons/FW/DT) | Dungeons, DT Hard, FW | +20% A3 damage | No benefit | ⭐ RECOMMENDED |
| **Giant Slayer** | 7.5% Enemy MAX HP (50% proc on bosses) | Clan Boss UNM | No benefit | +1.125M per A1 | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (if CB focus) |

---

### Key Mastery Highlights

**MUST-HAVE Masteries:**
1. **Flawless Execution (Tier 6 Offense):** +20% Crit Damage in Dungeons/FW/DT → mandatory for A3 Heartseeker damage
2. **Helmsmasher (Tier 5 Offense):** Ignore 25% DEF when Crit → synergy with Savage set (50% total DEF ignore)
3. **Lore of Steel (Tier 3 Support):** +15% set bonus effects → Critical Damage set +40% becomes +46%
4. **Pinpoint Accuracy + Charged Focus (Tier 1-2 Support):** +30 Accuracy total → helps reach 200-225+ Accuracy

**OPTIONAL Masteries:**
5. **Cycle of Violence (Tier 4 Offense):** 30% chance to reduce random skill cooldown by 1 turn when Crit → synergy with Reflex set (combined ~43% cooldown reduction chance)
6. **Kill Streak (Tier 5 Offense):** 30% chance to reduce all cooldowns by 1 turn when killing enemy with Crit → excellent for wave clear
7. **Blood Shield (Tier 5 Offense):** 30% chance to gain 10% Shield when Crit → survivability (Coldheart squishy)
8. **Swarm Smiter (Tier 4 Support):** +20% damage to targets with 2+ debuffs → synergy with Dec DEF + Weaken teams

**AVOID Masteries:**
9. **Warmaster (Tier 6 Offense):** 60% chance to deal 4% Enemy MAX HP damage when attacking → lower damage than Giant Slayer for 4-hit A1 (Warmaster better for single-hit champions)
10. **Defense Tree:** Coldheart is Attack champion (low HP/DEF) → Defense Tree not recommended (focus on damage)

### Current Owned Champions in Dark Elves Faction

**From User's Owned Champion List:**
- **Coldheart** (Rare, Void, Attack) - MAX HP damage dealer, TM control
- **[User to list other owned Dark Elves champions from `input/Owned_champion_list.md`]**

---

### Dark Elves Faction Wars Status

**User's Faction Wars Progress:**
- **Completed Normal:** Orc, Banner Lords, Barbarian, Dwarf
- **Near Completion:** Lizardmen, Knights Revenant, High Elf, Dark Elf ← **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Dark Elves:** Near completion → **Coldheart is CRITICAL for Stage 21 boss nuke**

---

### Faction Wars Team Recommendations

**Team 1: Coldheart Core (Stage 21 Boss Nuke)**

**Core Champions:**
- **Coldheart** (damage dealer, TM control, Heal Reduction)
- **[User to fill in other owned Dark Elves champions]**

**Strategy:**
- **Wave Clear (Stages 1-20):** Use AoE champions, crowd control (Stun/Provoke/Freeze), sustain (healer/shielder)
- **Boss Nuke (Stage 21):** Coldheart A3 Heartseeker nukes Valkyrie boss (10% MAX HP = 200k+ damage per hit), A1 applies Heal Reduction (prevents Valkyrie self-heal), 100% TM depletion prevents Valkyrie from taking turns
- **Coldheart role:** Break boss shield (A1 4 hits), nuke boss (A3 Heartseeker), control TM (100% TM depletion)

**Required Stats for Coldheart (Faction Wars Normal/Hard):**
- **70-100% Crit Rate** (70% minimum for A3 +30% = 100% Crit)
- **200-250% Crit Damage** (200%+ for Stage 21 boss nuke)
- **200-225 Accuracy** (200 for Stage 21, 225+ for Stage 21 Hard)
- **180-220 Speed** (200+ recommended for Stage 21)
- **30,000-40,000 HP** (survivability for Stages 1-20 waves)
- **2,000-2,500 DEF** (survivability)

### Ideal 5-Champion Pull List for Dark Elves Faction (Non-Owned Only)

**1. Lydia the Deathsiren (Legendary, Magic, Support) - CRITICAL**
- **Why:** Best Dark Elves champion, +25% SPD + 25% ACC aura (ALL BATTLES), AoE Dec DEF/Weaken, AoE TM boost, revive on death
- **Impact:** Game-changing for Faction Wars Hard (aura alone makes Stage 21 Hard trivial)
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (if available, pull immediately)

**2. Lua (Legendary, Magic, HP, Mythic) - CRITICAL**
- **Why:** AoE freeze + buff strip + Dec SPD, passive TM control, Mythic tier power
- **Impact:** Crowd control for Stages 1-20, TM control for Stage 21 boss
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (Mythic tier, best Dark Elves control champion)

**3. Karato Foxhunter (Legendary, Force, Attack) - HIGH**
- **Why:** AoE damage dealer, AoE Dec DEF, passive Increase ATK on kill
- **Impact:** Wave clear for Stages 1-20, damage for Stage 21
- **Priority:** HIGH (excellent wave clear + boss damage)

**4. Husk (Epic, Spirit, HP) - HIGH**
- **Why:** AoE Provoke + Dec ATK, passive Shield on ally death, tanky
- **Impact:** Crowd control for Stages 1-20, survivability for Stage 21
- **Priority:** HIGH (excellent tank/control for FW)

**5. Astralith (Epic, Magic, HP) - MEDIUM**
- **Why:** AoE heal + cleanse + revive, sustain champion
- **Impact:** Survivability for Stages 1-20, revive for Stage 21 (if Coldheart dies)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (sustain helps, but not mandatory if user has other healers)

**Note:** These recommendations are for champions **NOT on the user's owned list**. After user provides owned Dark Elves champions, this list will be updated to remove any owned champions.

## Team Synergies & Pairings

### Best Champions to Pair with Coldheart (From Owned Roster)

**1. Tayrel (Epic, Magic, Defense) - CRITICAL SYNERGY**
- **Why:** +15 SPD Dungeons aura (SAFE), A2 Dec DEF 60% (2 turns), A3 AoE Dec ATK 50% (2 turns)
- **Synergy:** Tayrel's Dec DEF amplifies Coldheart's A3 Heartseeker damage (60% Dec DEF = ~2.5x damage multiplier)
- **Example (Spider 25):** Coldheart A3 with Dec DEF = 1.5M damage → without Dec DEF = 600k damage
- **User's owned:** YES (Tayrel owned, confirmed)

**2. Deacon Armstrong (Epic, Magic, Support) - CRITICAL SYNERGY**
- **Why:** +19% SPD Dungeons aura (SAFE), A2 AoE Dec DEF 60% (2 turns), A3 AoE TM boost 30% + Dec TM 30%
- **Synergy:** Deacon's Dec DEF amplifies Coldheart's A3 damage, TM boost allows Coldheart to cast A3 faster
- **User's owned:** YES (Deacon owned, confirmed)

**3. Nogdar the Headhunter (Legendary, Force, Support) x2 - CHEESE SYNERGY**
- **Why:** A3 Ally Attack (all allies attack target, 5-turn cooldown → 4 booked), +15% TM boost on kill
- **Cheese potential:** Double Nogdar + Triple Coldheart = Ally Attack x2 → Coldheart A3 x6 casts = 60% Enemy MAX HP damage (instant boss kill)
- **User's owned:** YES (Nogdar x2 owned, confirmed)

**4. Arbiter (Legendary, Magic, Support) - HIGH SYNERGY**
- **Why:** +30% SPD Arena aura (restricted, does not work in Dungeons), A2 AoE TM boost 30%, A3 AoE revive + ATK/TM boost
- **Synergy:** Arbiter's TM boost allows Coldheart to cast A3 faster, revive if Coldheart dies
- **User's owned:** YES (Arbiter owned, confirmed)

**5. Skullcrusher (Epic, Void, Defense) - HIGH SYNERGY**
- **Why:** A3 Counterattack (2 turns, 5-turn cooldown → 4 booked), Ally Protection (3 turns)
- **Synergy:** Counterattack doubles Coldheart's turn cycling (more A3 casts), Ally Protection protects Coldheart (squishy)
- **User's owned:** YES (Skullcrusher owned, confirmed)

**6. Geomancer (Legendary, Magic, Attack) - HIGH SYNERGY**
- **Why:** Passive Reflect Damage (10% damage taken by all allies → reflected to all enemies), HP Burn (A2)
- **Synergy:** Geomancer's Reflect Damage + HP Burn synergizes with Coldheart's MAX HP damage (both scale with Enemy MAX HP)
- **User's owned:** YES (Geomancer owned, confirmed)

**7. Wukong (Legendary, Force, Attack, Mythic) - MEDIUM SYNERGY**
- **Why:** +24% SPD All Battles aura (SAFE), A2 AoE Dec DEF 60%, A3 nuke + sheep control
- **Synergy:** Wukong's Dec DEF amplifies Coldheart's A3 damage, speed lead helps Coldheart go first
- **User's owned:** YES (Wukong owned, confirmed)

**8. Michelangelo (Legendary, Void, HP, Mythic) - MEDIUM SYNERGY**
- **Why:** Debuff spread (A2), Evade + Taunt (A3), crowd control
- **Synergy:** Michelangelo's Taunt protects Coldheart (draws enemy attacks away), debuff spread enables Coldheart's A3 to hit debuffed targets (Swarm Smiter mastery +20% damage)
- **User's owned:** YES (Michelangelo owned, confirmed)

**9. Stag Knight (Legendary, Spirit, Support) - MEDIUM SYNERGY**
- **Why:** +24% SPD Dungeons aura (restricted), A2 AoE Dec DEF 60% + Dec ATK 50% (2 turns), Passive Inc ACC
- **Synergy:** Stag Knight's Dec DEF amplifies Coldheart's A3 damage, restricted aura limits use (Dungeons only)
- **User's owned:** YES (Stag Knight owned, confirmed)

## Cheese Strategy Integration

### Triple Coldheart Cheese (Spider 25/Fire Knight 25) ⭐ HIGHEST DAMAGE POTENTIAL

**Cheese Type:** MAX HP Damage Cheese (instant boss kill)

**Required Champions:**
- **3x Coldheart** (user owns 1, needs 2 more from Void Shards)
- **2x Nogdar the Headhunter** (Ally Attack spam, user owns 2 ✅)
- **Alternative Ally Attack:** Longbeard (Epic, Magic, Support), Lanakis the Chosen (Legendary, Magic, Support)

**Cheese Viability:** CRITICAL (STRICTLY BETTER than conventional teams for Spider/Fire Knight speed nuke)

**Safety Level:** SAFE (consistent, reliable, not RNG-dependent IF all champions built correctly)

**Content Applications:**
- **Spider 25:** Triple Coldheart + Double Nogdar = instant Spider boss kill (A3 x3 = 30% Enemy MAX HP damage per rotation)
- **Fire Knight 25:** Triple Coldheart + Double Nogdar = instant FK boss kill (A1 x3 breaks shield, A3 x3 nukes boss)
- **Dragon 25:** Less effective (Dragon immune to TM depletion, but still high damage)
- **Ice Golem 25:** Effective (MAX HP damage + TM control)

**Setup Requirements:**

**Champions:**
- **3x Coldheart:** 70% Crit Rate (for A3 +30% = 100% Crit), 200%+ Crit Damage, 200+ ACC, 180-220 SPD
- **2x Nogdar:** 220-250 SPD (faster than Coldheart), 250+ ACC (for Dec DEF), 50k+ HP, 3k+ DEF (survivability)
- **Speed tuning:** Nogdar 1 (fastest, 250 SPD) → Nogdar 2 (240 SPD) → Coldheart 1 (220 SPD) → Coldheart 2 (210 SPD) → Coldheart 3 (200 SPD)

**Skill Order (Manual):**
- Turn 1: Nogdar 1 A3 Ally Attack → All 5 champions attack (Coldheart x3 A3 Heartseeker = 30% Enemy MAX HP damage)
- Turn 2: Nogdar 2 A3 Ally Attack → All 5 champions attack (Coldheart x3 A3 Heartseeker = 30% Enemy MAX HP damage)
- Turn 3: Coldheart x3 A3 Heartseeker individual casts (30% Enemy MAX HP damage)
- **Total damage:** 90% Enemy MAX HP damage in 3 turns (instant boss kill)

**Gear (All 3 Coldheart):**
- **Set 1 (Fastest Coldheart):** Critical Damage + Speed (220 SPD, 70% Crit, 200% Crit Damage, 200 ACC)
- **Set 2 (Mid Coldheart):** Critical Damage + Accuracy (210 SPD, 70% Crit, 200% Crit Damage, 200 ACC)
- **Set 3 (Slowest Coldheart):** Critical Damage + Perception (200 SPD, 70% Crit, 200% Crit Damage, 225 ACC)

**Masteries (All 3 Coldheart):**
- **Flawless Execution** (Tier 6 Offense) → +20% Crit Damage in Dungeons
- **Helmsmasher** (Tier 5 Offense) → Ignore 25% DEF when Crit
- **Lore of Steel** (Tier 3 Support) → +15% set bonus effects

**Expected Results:**
- **Spider 25 clear time:** 30-60 seconds (manual, instant boss kill)
- **Fire Knight 25 clear time:** 45-90 seconds (manual, instant boss kill)
- **Success rate:** 95%+ (if all champions built correctly, 5% failure due to weak hits on boss)

**Community Validation:**
- **mortuar996 (May 2025):** "does anyone still use coldheart in 2025?" → Response: "Yes, triple Coldheart cheese still works for Spider/FK speed nuke"
- **ASH video (2022):** Showcases Reflex Coldheart speed nuke (single Coldheart, not triple)
- **NewOnBoard (Feb 2022):** "I put her in Reflex Set with Speed and Acc + A2 deactivated. Paired with Allure (only A1 activated)... Fireknight has no chance at all" → Confirms Coldheart + TM control cheese

**User's Current Status:**
- **Coldheart owned:** 1 (needs 2 more from Void Shards)
- **Nogdar owned:** 2 ✅ (cheese strategy ready)
- **Recommendation:** Pull 2 more Coldheart from Void Shards → enable triple Coldheart cheese (STRICTLY BETTER than conventional teams)

**Cross-Reference to Boss Guides:**
- **Spider Hard Team Notes (FINAL):** Section 11 - Add Triple Coldheart Cheese as "Additional Team Archetype"
- **Fire Knight Hard Team Notes (FINAL):** Section 11 - Add Triple Coldheart Cheese as "Additional Team Archetype"

### Similar Champions with Comparable Utility

**Champions with MAX HP Damage:**
1. **Royal Guard (Epic, Void, Attack):** A3 AoE MAX HP damage (0.1 Enemy MAX HP), no TM control → similar to Coldheart but AoE instead of single-target
2. **Sethalia (Legendary, Magic, HP):** A2 MAX HP damage (0.1 Enemy MAX HP), A3 AoE Dec DEF → similar to Coldheart but tankier (HP champion)
3. **Husk (Epic, Spirit, HP):** A2 MAX HP damage (0.075 Enemy MAX HP), lower multiplier → inferior to Coldheart

**Champions with Turn Meter Control:**
1. **Armiger (Rare, Magic, Attack):** A1 30% Dec TM (100% with books), 3-turn cooldown → superior TM control frequency, but no MAX HP damage
2. **Alure (Rare, Magic, Attack):** A1 Dec TM 15% per hit (4 hits = 60% Dec TM), no cooldown → superior TM control, but no MAX HP damage

**User's Owned Champions with MAX HP/TM Control:**
- **Coldheart (Rare, Void, Attack):** 0.1 MAX HP + 100% TM depletion + 30% Crit bonus → BEST combination of MAX HP damage + TM control
- **Ninja (Legendary, Magic, Attack):** A3 MAX HP damage + Freeze, but no TM depletion → inferior TM control
- **[User to note if Royal Guard, Sethalia, Armiger, Alure owned]**

## Investment Recommendations

### Priority Level: **HIGH** (Top 10 in Roster)

**Why HIGH Priority:**
- **10/10 Dungeons** (BEST MAX HP damage champion for Spider, Fire Knight, Dragon, Ice Golem)
- **9/10 Doom Tower Hard** (BEST for Secret Rooms + boss nuking)
- **8/10 Faction Wars** (CRITICAL for Dark Elves Stage 21 completion)
- **Triple Coldheart cheese potential** (user owns 1, needs 2 more → STRICTLY BETTER than conventional teams)
- **S-tier Rare** (best Rare champion in game for PVE content)

**Why NOT CRITICAL Priority:**
- **User has well-built HP Burn teams** (Artak, Ninja, Geomancer) → Coldheart not mandatory for Dungeons (HP Burn teams already strong)
- **User's Clan Boss UNM team established** (Skullcrusher, Geomancer, Frozen Banshee, Tayrel, Vogoth) → Coldheart 7/10 CB UNM (not needed)
- **Arena low priority** (6/10 Arena, user's core Arena team already strong: Wukong, Mithrala, Loki)

### PVE Disclaimer

- **Books:** A3 + A1 (8 Epic Books total, skip A2)
- **Masteries:** Flawless Execution (130 scrolls)

### When to Stop Investment

**Stop Investment If:**
1. **User already has Spider 25/Fire Knight 25 teams with <2 minute clear times** → Coldheart not needed (HP Burn teams already strong)
2. **User has Royal Guard or Sethalia built** → similar MAX HP damage, Coldheart less critical
3. **User cannot pull 2 more Coldheart from Void Shards** → triple Coldheart cheese not viable, single Coldheart less impactful
4. **User prioritizes Clan Boss UNM over Dungeons** → Coldheart 7/10 CB UNM (not optimal)

**Continue Investment If:**
1. **User needs faster Dungeons 25 clear times** → Coldheart's A3 Heartseeker reduces clear time by 50%+
2. **User struggles with Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms** → Coldheart's MAX HP damage trivializes bosses
3. **User needs Dark Elves Faction Wars Stage 21 completion** → Coldheart CRITICAL for boss nuke
4. **User can pull 2 more Coldheart from Void Shards** → triple Coldheart cheese STRICTLY BETTER than conventional teams

## Final Verdict

### Champion Summary

**Coldheart (Rare, Void, Attack, Dark Elves)** is an **S-tier Rare champion** and the **best Rare in RAID Shadow Legends for PVE content** (Dungeons, Doom Tower Hard, Faction Wars). Her unique combination of **MAX HP damage (A3 Heartseeker: 1.7 ATK + 0.1 Enemy MAX HP)**, **100% Turn Meter depletion**, and **30% extra Crit Rate on A3** makes her **unmatched for boss nuking** in Spider 25, Fire Knight 25, Dragon 25, Ice Golem 25, and Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ **10/10 Dungeons** (BEST MAX HP damage champion in user's roster for Spider, Fire Knight, Dragon, Ice Golem)
- ✅ **9/10 Doom Tower Hard** (BEST for Secret Rooms + boss nuking)
- ✅ **8/10 Faction Wars** (CRITICAL for Dark Elves Stage 21 boss nuke)
- ✅ **Triple Coldheart cheese potential** (user owns 1, needs 2 more → 90% Enemy MAX HP damage in 3 turns)
- ✅ **Void affinity** (no weak hits, works against all boss affinities)
- ✅ **Rare rarity** (easier to skill up than Epic/Legendary, lower book cost)

**Key Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Very low base HP/DEF** (squishy, requires Shield buffs, crowd control, OR speed nuke teams)
- ❌ **AI issues** (always uses A2 first → disable A2 for Spider/Fire Knight to prioritize A3)
- ❌ **Turn Meter nerf** (changed from "Fully deplete" to "100% reduction" → Spider can exceed 100% TM with Spiderlings)
- ❌ **Dragon 25 nerf** (Dragon immune to TM reduction after Apr 2024 Plarium update → A3 still deals MAX HP damage, but no TM control)
- ❌ **Clan Boss limitation** (Heartseeker capped at 10% MAX HP per hit on bosses → 75k damage max on CB UNM)

**Best Use Cases:**
1. **Spider 25 speed nuke** (A3 nukes boss for 10% MAX HP = 500k+ damage, TM control prevents Spider from taking turns)
2. **Fire Knight 25 speed nuke** (A1 4-hit breaks shield, A3 nukes boss for 10% MAX HP = massive damage)
3. **Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms** (A3 trivializes all bosses except Bommal/Scarab/Nether Spider)
4. **Dark Elves Faction Wars Stage 21** (A3 nukes Valkyrie boss, TM control + Heal Reduction)
5. **Triple Coldheart cheese** (user owns 2x Nogdar, needs 2 more Coldheart → STRICTLY BETTER than conventional teams)

**Investment Priority:** **HIGH (Top 10 in Roster)**

**Recommended Build:** **Critical Damage + Accuracy (All-Rounder)** OR **Reflex + Speed (Spider/FK Speed Nuke)**

**Recommended Masteries:** **Flawless Execution** (Dungeons/DT Hard focus, +20% Crit Damage)

**Booking Priority:** **A3 Heartseeker CRITICAL (4 Epic Books)**, then A1 (4 Epic Books), skip A2

**User-Specific Recommendation:**
- **Build Coldheart for Dungeons 25 + Doom Tower Hard** (user's Priority 2 and 3 content)
- **Use Coldheart for Dark Elves Faction Wars Stage 21** (near completion, HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Pull 2 more Coldheart from Void Shards** (enable triple Coldheart cheese → STRICTLY BETTER than conventional teams)
- **Do NOT build for Clan Boss UNM** (user has well-built HP Burn teams, Coldheart 7/10 CB UNM)

**Final Rating:** **10/10 Dungeons, 9/10 Doom Tower Hard, 8/10 Faction Wars, 7/10 Clan Boss UNM, 6/10 Arena** → **S-tier Rare, BEST Rare in RAID for PVE content**
