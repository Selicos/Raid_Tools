## 1. Champion Overview

**Name:** Underpriest Brogni  
**Rarity:** Legendary  
**Affinity:** Magic  
**Faction:** Dwarves  
**Role:** Support (Shield Specialist, Buffer, HP Burn Debuffer)

**Primary Use Cases:**
- **Clan Boss UNM** (Priority 1): Infinity Shield teams, Super Tanky teams, reflect damage strategies
- **Dungeons** (Priority 2): All dungeons (Dragon, Spider, Fire Knight, Ice Golem), especially Dragon
- **Doom Tower Hard** (Priority 3): Boss floors and wave control
- **Arena** (Priority 4): Defense teams (Shield + Block Debuffs + Counterattack synergies)

## 2. Content-Specific Ratings (X/10 Contextualized)

**Validation Note:** Ratings compare Brogni to owned champions who provide similar mechanics (Shield, Block Debuffs, HP Burn, Buff/Debuff removal).

### Priority 1: Clan Boss UNM
**Rating: 10/10 - Best Shield champion in your roster**

**Context:** Brogni is the ONLY owned champion who provides:
- Unremovable Shield (A3)
- Shield Growth mechanic (A2 increases shield capacity by 30% of damage dealt)
- Shield-based reflect damage (Passive: 25% damage reflect + 25% heal when allies under shield are attacked)

**Validated Comparison:** 
- **No other owned champion** can build "Infinity Shield" or "Super Tanky" strategies (requires Brogni's unique Shield Growth on A2)
- Other owned Shield champions (Mausoleum Mage, Godseeker Aniri, Vergis) provide one-time shields with NO growth mechanic
- Brogni's Unremovable Shield cannot be dispelled by Clan Boss (huge advantage over all other Shield champions)

**Key Strengths for Clan Boss:**
- Passive reflects 25% of Clan Boss damage back (procs Giant Slayer multiple times per attack when all 5 allies have Shield)
- Passive heals allies by 25% of damage inflicted on Shield (sustain without healer)
- A1 HP Burn adds 15-20M damage over full UNM run
- A3 Block Debuffs prevents Stun/Decrease Speed from disrupting speed tune
- A3 Increase ATK (50%, 2 turns) boosts team damage

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + HellHades (2/2 sources agree)

---

### Priority 2: Dungeons (Dragon 25, Spider 25, Fire Knight 25, Ice Golem 25)
**Rating: 9/10 - Excellent all-rounder, slightly behind specialized nukers for speed runs**

**Context:** Brogni excels at safety and consistency but lacks the raw wave clear speed of champions like Wukong, Ithos, or Abbess.

**Dragon 25:**
- **9/10**: Shield + Block Debuffs prevents dragon waves from wiping team
- A1 HP Burn adds 10-15% total damage
- Passive reflect damage helps clear waves
- **Owned champions with faster clears:** Wukong (AOE nuke), Ithos (AOE nuke), Ninja (HP Burn + Freeze)

**Spider 25:**
- **9/10**: Shield + Passive reflect damage counters spiderling attacks
- A1 HP Burn helps kill spiderlings and boss
- **Owned champions with faster clears:** Drexthar (Passive HP Burn specialist), Triple Coldheart + Ally Attack cheese (MAX HP damage)

**Fire Knight 25:**
- **8/10**: A2 AOE (Buff Removal + Shield Growth) is useful, but single-hit A1 is slow for shield removal
- **Owned champions with faster clears:** Ninja (4-hit A1), Alure (TM control), Coldheart (x3)

**Ice Golem 25:**
- **9/10**: Block Debuffs counters Freeze, Shield counters reflect damage
- **Owned champions with faster clears:** Wukong, Ithos (wave clear speed)

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + HellHades (2/2 sources agree)

---

### Priority 3: Doom Tower Hard
**Rating: 10/10 - Best defensive support for bosses and wave floors**

**Context:** Brogni's Unremovable Shield, Block Debuffs, and Doom Tower Resist Aura (60%) make him best-in-class for Doom Tower Hard among owned champions.

**Key Strengths:**
- Unremovable Shield prevents bosses from stripping protection
- Block Debuffs (2 turns) counters boss debuff mechanics
- Doom Tower Resist Aura (60%) stacks with high Resist builds for near-immunity
- Passive reflect damage + heal sustains team through long boss fights

**Validated Comparison:**
- **No other owned champion** provides both Unremovable Shield AND Block Debuffs
- Mausoleum Mage (Block Debuffs, but removable Shield)
- Scyl of the Drakes (Revive + Stun, but no Shield or Block Debuffs)
- Vogoth (sustain tank, but no Block Debuffs)

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + HellHades (2/2 sources agree)

---

### Priority 4: Arena (Classic Gold 3+, Tag Team Bronze 3+)
**Rating: 8/10 - Excellent for defense teams, less optimal for offense due to speed requirements**

**Context:** Brogni is strong on defense but requires high Speed and Accuracy to compete in Gold 3+ offense.

**Arena Defense:**
- **9/10**: Unremovable Shield counters buff strip teams
- Block Debuffs (2 turns) counters control teams
- Passive reflect damage punishes enemy nukers (25% damage reflect)
- Synergy with Skullcrusher (Counterattack) or Mausoleum Mage (Ally Protection)

**Arena Offense:**
- **7/10**: Requires 260+ Speed to compete in Gold 3, 280+ for Gold 4+
- User often loses speed battle in higher tiers (Brogni NOT optimal for speed-focused offense)
- Better for tanky/sustain offense teams (Vogoth + Rector Drath + Brogni)

**Validated via:** Ayumilove + HellHades + User preferences (noted: "Often loses speed battle in higher Arena tiers")

---

### Priority 5: Faction Wars (Dwarves)
**Rating: 10/10 - Best Dwarves champion for Faction Wars (tied with Maulie Tankard for sustain)**

**Context:** Brogni's Shield + Block Debuffs + HP Burn makes him essential for Dwarves Faction Wars.

**Key Strengths:**
- Unremovable Shield sustains team through difficult waves
- Block Debuffs counters high-damage debuff stages
- A1 HP Burn adds consistent damage (important for stages with high HP enemies)
- Passive reflect damage helps clear waves

**Owned Dwarves Champions:** Brogni, Maulie Tankard, Runekeeper Dazdurk

**Validated Comparison:**
- Brogni (10/10): Best all-rounder (Shield + Block Debuffs + HP Burn + Reflect damage)
- Maulie Tankard (9/10): Excellent sustain (Block Debuffs + Ally Protection + Revive), but no Shield or HP Burn
- Runekeeper Dazdurk (6/10): Decent support, but outclassed by Brogni and Maulie

---

## 4. Gear Recommendations (Option C: General Sets + Detailed Artifacts)

### General Sets (Always Include)

**Primary Sets:**
- **Speed + Perception** (PVE standard): 220+ Speed, 250+ Accuracy for HP Burn and Buff Removal
- **Shield + Immortal** (Clan Boss Infinity Shield): Maximizes shield capacity for Shield Growth mechanic
- **Relentless + Immortal** (Doom Tower Hard): Extra turns for more Block Debuffs uptime

**Alternative Sets:**
- **Reflex** (cooldown reduction for A3): More frequent Unremovable Shield + Block Debuffs
- **Regeneration** (sustain for long fights)
- **Resistance** (pair with Doom Tower Resist Aura for near-immunity)

### Detailed Artifacts (Always Include)

**Banner:** Accuracy or Resist  
**Chest:** HP% or DEF%  
**Boots:** Speed (almost always)  
**Gloves:** HP% or DEF%  
**Weapon/Helmet/Shield:** Prioritize substats (Speed, Accuracy, HP, DEF, Resist)

### Stat Priorities (Always Include)

**Clan Boss UNM:**
- 220-270 Speed (speed tune dependent)
- 250+ Accuracy (HP Burn, Buff Removal)
- 70k+ HP (30% of MAX HP = 21k Shield on A3)
- 3k+ DEF (reduce damage intake)
- 200+ Resist (optional, for debuff immunity)

**Dungeons:**

## 5. Masteries

### PVE (Clan Boss, Dungeons, Doom Tower)

**Offense Tree:**
- Deadly Precision, Keen Strike
- Single Out, Life Drinker
- Bring it Down
- Wrath of the Slain (optional, for damage)
- Methodical
- **GIANT SLAYER** (T6 - CRITICAL for Clan Boss)

**CRITICAL: Warmaster/Giant Slayer C.RATE Dependency**

Warmaster and Giant Slayer masteries **ONLY proc on critical hits**:
- **Effective Proc Rate = C.RATE × Base Proc Rate**
- **Warmaster:** 60% base → 60% at 100% C.RATE, 51% at 85% C.RATE (15% damage loss)
- **Giant Slayer:** 30% base → 30% at 100% C.RATE, 25.5% at 85% C.RATE (15% damage loss)

**Why this matters for Brogni:**
- Brogni is a SUPPORT champion (not damage dealer), so C.RATE is LOW PRIORITY
- Giant Slayer procs will be infrequent without C.RATE investment
- **Recommendation:** Accept lower mastery damage in exchange for maximizing HP/DEF/ACC/SPD
- If you have excess C.RATE substats, it will boost Giant Slayer damage slightly, but don't sacrifice core stats for it

**Support Tree:**
- Steadfast
- Lay on Hands
- Shieldbearer (boosts Shield capacity)
- Rapid Response (extra healing when ally drops below 50% HP)
- Healing Savior
- Lore of Steel (boosts Set bonuses)
- Merciful Aid
- Lasting Gifts (extends buff duration, including Shield)

### PVP (Arena)

**Defense Tree:**
- Defiant, Rejuvenation
- Shadow Heal
- Solidarity (share debuffs with allies)
- Delay Death (survive fatal hit once per battle)
- Cycle of Revenge
- Retribution (counterattack when hit)
- Unshakeable (immunity to Stun/Freeze/Sleep for 1 turn after debuff removed)

**Support Tree:**
- Steadfast
- Lay on Hands
- Shieldbearer
- Healing Savior
- Rapid Response
- Merciful Aid
- Lasting Gifts

## 6. Faction Wars Advice

### Owned Dwarves Champions (Current Roster)
- Underpriest Brogni (Legendary, Magic) - Support (Shield, Block Debuffs, HP Burn)
- Maulie Tankard (Legendary, Magic) - Tank/Support (Block Debuffs, Ally Protection, Revive)
- Runekeeper Dazdurk (Epic, Magic) - Support (Decrease DEF, Weaken, Ally Protection)

### Dwarves Faction Wars Team Recommendations

**Team 1: Brogni + Maulie Core (Safe, Consistent)**
- **Core:** Brogni (Shield + Block Debuffs), Maulie (Ally Protection + Revive)
- **Supports:** Runekeeper Dazdurk (Decrease DEF + Weaken)
- **Notes:** Need 2 more Dwarves champions to complete team (ideally damage dealers or additional support)

**Gaps:**
- No dedicated damage dealer (nuker or HP Burn specialist)
- No TM control or speed manipulation
- Need 2 more Dwarves champions

### Ideal 5-Champion Pull List (Non-Owned Only)

1. **Trunda Giltmallet** (Legendary, Magic)
   - **Rationale:** Best Dwarves nuker (AOE Ignore DEF nuke, DEF-based scaling)
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - Enables wave clear and boss damage
   - **Priority:** Pull FIRST

2. **Rearguard Sergeant** (Epic, Spirit)
   - **Rationale:** Ally Protection + Counterattack + Decrease ATK
   - **Impact:** HIGH - Adds sustain and damage
   - **Priority:** Pull SECOND

3. **Grizzled Jarl** (Epic, Magic)
   - **Rationale:** AOE Decrease DEF + Weaken (better than Runekeeper Dazdurk)
   - **Impact:** HIGH - Boosts team damage
   - **Priority:** Pull THIRD

4. **Rock Breaker** (Rare, Force)
   - **Rationale:** Decrease DEF + Weaken + DEF-based damage dealer
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM - Budget damage dealer
   - **Priority:** Pull FOURTH

5. **Kurzad Deepheart** (Epic, Void)
   - **Rationale:** Shield + Increase DEF + Heal
   - **Impact:** MEDIUM - Additional support/sustain
   - **Priority:** Pull FIFTH

## 7. Team Synergies & Pairings

### Best Champions to Pair With (From Owned Roster)

**Validated Pairings:**

1. **Maulie Tankard** (owned)
   - **Synergy:** Block Debuffs (Brogni) + Block Debuffs (Maulie) = near-permanent immunity
   - **Use Case:** Doom Tower Hard bosses, Faction Wars Dwarves
   - **Cheese Potential:** Double Block Debuffs cheese for high-debuff bosses

2. **Skullcrusher** (owned)
   - **Synergy:** Counterattack (Skullcrusher) + Passive Reflect (Brogni) = massive damage output
   - **Use Case:** Clan Boss UNM, Dungeons, Arena Defense
   - **Notes:** Synergy requires all allies to have Shield buff (Brogni A3) + Counterattack (Skullcrusher A2)

3. **Mausoleum Mage** (owned)
   - **Synergy:** Increase Buff Duration (Mausoleum Mage A2) extends Brogni's Shield from 2 turns → 3+ turns
   - **Use Case:** Infinity Shield Clan Boss teams
   - **Notes:** Enables "Infinity Shield" strategy (requires careful speed tuning)

4. **Godseeker Aniri** (owned, x2)
   - **Synergy:** Revive + Ally Protection + Cleanse complements Brogni's Shield + Block Debuffs
   - **Use Case:** Doom Tower Hard, Faction Wars, Dungeons
   - **Notes:** Strong defensive pairing for safety-focused teams

5. **Artak** (owned)
   - **Synergy:** HP Burn (Brogni A1) + HP Burn (Artak A3) + Artak A2 (instantly activates HP Burns)
   - **Use Case:** Dragon, Spider, Ice Golem, Doom Tower Hard
   - **Notes:** Double HP Burn teams excel in dungeons and Doom Tower

### Similar Champions with Comparable Utility (Owned Only)

**Validated Comparison:**

1. **Maulie Tankard (9/10):**
   - **Similar:** Block Debuffs (2 turns), Ally Protection (2 turns), Revive
   - **Different:** No Shield, no HP Burn, no Reflect Damage, no Shield Growth
   - **When to use Maulie instead:** When Revive is critical (e.g., Faction Wars Hard stages)

2. **Mausoleum Mage (8/10):**
   - **Similar:** Block Debuffs (2 turns), Shield (2 turns), Increase Buff Duration
   - **Different:** Removable Shield (can be stripped), no Reflect Damage, no HP Burn, no Shield Growth
   - **When to use Mausoleum Mage instead:** When Increase Buff Duration is needed for other team buffs

3. **Godseeker Aniri (8/10):**
   - **Similar:** Shield (2 turns), Ally Protection (2 turns), Revive, Cleanse
   - **Different:** Removable Shield, no Block Debuffs, no HP Burn, no Reflect Damage
   - **When to use Godseeker Aniri instead:** When Revive + Cleanse is critical (e.g., Doom Tower Hard bosses)

4. **Vergis (7/10):**
   - **Similar:** Shield (passive, on self), Ally Protection (2 turns), Unkillable (self)
   - **Different:** Self-only Shield and Unkillable (not team-wide), no Block Debuffs, no HP Burn
   - **When to use Vergis instead:** Solo tank strategies (e.g., Scarab King solo, Bommal solo)

**Summary:** Brogni is best-in-class for Shield-based strategies among owned champions due to Unremovable Shield, Shield Growth, and Reflect Damage. No other owned champion combines these three mechanics.

## 8. Investment Recommendations

### Priority Level: **CRITICAL** (Top 3 champions in roster)

**Rationale:**
- Brogni enables "Infinity Shield" and "Super Tanky" Clan Boss UNM strategies (best sustain teams in game)
- Brogni is best defensive support for Doom Tower Hard (Priority 3)
- Brogni is essential for Dwarves Faction Wars (Priority 5)
- Brogni is versatile across ALL content areas (Clan Boss, Dungeons, Doom Tower, Arena, Faction Wars)

### Investment Order:

**Step 1: Level to 60, Full Ascension (6 stars)**
- Required for endgame content (Clan Boss UNM, Doom Tower Hard)

**Step 2: Full Skill Books (12 total)**
- **Priority Order:** A3 → A2 → A1
- **A3 (5 books):** -2 turn cooldown (5 → 3 turns) - CRITICAL for more frequent Unremovable Shield + Block Debuffs
- **A2 (4 books):** -1 turn cooldown (4 → 3 turns) + increased Buff/Debuff removal chance (75% → 100%)
- **A1 (3 books):** Increased HP Burn chance (45% → 60%)

**Step 3: Full Masteries (Giant Slayer for PVE)**
- **CRITICAL:** Giant Slayer (T6 Offense) procs multiple times per Clan Boss attack when allies have Shield

**Step 4: Optimal Gear (70k+ HP, 220+ SPD, 250+ ACC)**
- Focus on HP% chest/gloves for maximum Shield capacity
- Speed boots mandatory
- Accuracy banner for HP Burn and Buff Removal

### When to Stop Investment:

**Do NOT stop until fully invested.** Brogni is a game-changer and requires full investment to unlock his potential.

**PVE Disclaimer:** This champion requires full booking and optimal gear (70k+ HP, 220+ SPD, 250+ ACC) for optimal performance in Clan Boss UNM and Doom Tower Hard.
