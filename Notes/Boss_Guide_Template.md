## Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
- **Boss:** Ultra-Nightmare Clan Boss (UNM)
- **Key Mechanics:**
  - [List boss mechanics, immunities, affinity changes, unique challenges]
  - **Affinity:** [Specify affinity for the current rotation; note if it changes. Affinity can make or break certain teams.]
- **Required Stats:**
  - Speed: [e.g., 250–280+ for 2:1 teams]
  - Accuracy: [e.g., 230–250+ for debuffs]
  - Resistance: [If using resist strategy or to block debuffs; may require very high stats, especially if affinity is unfavorable]
  - HP%/DEF%: [as high as possible for survivability]
  - Crit Rate/Damage: [for damage dealers]
  - Lifesteal/Leech: [for sustain]
- **Special Notes:**
  - Affinity issues: [Note which champions are weak/strong vs. current affinity; avoid weak affinity cleansers or block debuffs]
  - Manual play may be required for skill timing, especially for cleanses/block debuffs. Prefer full auto teams if possible.
  - Speed tuning is essential for debuff uptime and survival. Check champion skill cooldown when checking speed tune advice and attack order for each champion and the team overall.
  - [Manual/auto play notes, and information about unique boss mechanics to now (3 items), speed tuning importance, calculator recommendations]
