## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
- **Boss:** Ultra-Nightmare Clan Boss (UNM)
  - [List boss mechanics, immunities, affinity changes, unique challenges]
  - **Affinity:** [Specify affinity for the current rotation; note if it changes. Affinity can make or break certain teams.]
  - Accuracy: [e.g., 230–250+ for debuffs]
  - Resistance: [If using resist strategy or to block debuffs; may require very high stats, especially if affinity is unfavorable]
  - Crit Rate/Damage: [for damage dealers]
  - Lifesteal/Leech: [for sustain]
- **Special Notes:**
  - Affinity issues: [Note which champions are weak/strong vs. current affinity; avoid weak affinity cleansers or block debuffs]
  - Manual play may be required for skill timing, especially for cleanses/block debuffs. Prefer full auto teams if possible.
  - Speed tuning is essential for debuff uptime and survival. Check champion skill cooldown when checking speed tune advice and attack order for each champion and the team overall.

### Manual/Auto Play Notes
- [When manual play is required, AI preset tips, affinity-specific tuning, etc.]

## 2. Teams by Estimated Damage/Clear Speed
| Team Name | Simulated Damage (Avg) | Core Champions (Sample) | Key Mechanics & Notes | Affinity Safety/Risk |
|---|:---:|---|---|---|
| [Team 1 Name] | [Damage] | [Champion List] | [Strengths, weaknesses, when to use] | **Affinity Safety/Risk:**<br>- Void: Safe for all roles.<br>- Magic: Risk for Force champions (weak hits, unreliable debuffs).<br>- Force: Risk for Magic champions (weak hits, unreliable debuffs).<br>- Spirit: Risk for Force champions (weak hits, unreliable debuffs). |

## 3. Detailed Team Sections (by Archetype)

### 2:1 Speed Tune Teams
[Short intro: These teams take two turns for every one Clan Boss turn, maximizing debuff uptime, skill cycling, and overall damage.]

#### Team 1: [Team Name]
<!-- When writing team sections, highlight affinity safety or risk for each team if relevant. -->
**Core Roles:** [e.g., HP Burn, TM Booster, Buff Extender, Poisoners, Support/Revive]

**Optimal Combo:** [Champion List]

**Alternates:** [Possible replacements for each role]

**Team Variations:**
- Generate teams based on the owned champion list, suggest variations based on boss mechanics, affinity, or play style (e.g., manual vs auto, affinity risk, clear speed, etc.).
- Complete analysis for each team for speed tuning, mastery preference, gear, manual/auto changes, strengths, weaknesses, and simulated damage or speed for clearing the dungeon.
- Prefer reliable auto teams for dungeon bosses and clan bosses.
- Create teams based on likely mechanics to scale damage and survivability ex HP burn, poison, turn meter control, other debuffs, and the required buffs and role combos to ensure survivability and dungeon success.
- Use the example format for a team below, and add sections for each team tested and set up.
- After the teams are populated, check damage or dungeon speed.

**Speed Tuning:** [Speed ranges for each champion]

**Gear:** [Recommended sets and stat priorities]

**Masteries:** [Key masteries for each role]

**Manual/Auto:** [Manual/auto advice, skill order, special notes]

**Strengths:** [List]

**Weaknesses:** [List]

**Simulated Damage:** [Value or range]

## Team suggestions
- Using the owned champion list, create teams that can manage the boss and mechanics. Suggest teams that use HP Burn and poison (if helpful), TM control and debuffs that work on the boss, high survivability and high damage or fast teams.
- Use the format above like:
  - **Speed Tuning:** [Speed ranges for each champion]
  - **Gear:** [Recommended sets and stat priorities]
  - **Masteries:** [Key masteries for each role]
  - **Manual/Auto:** [Manual/auto advice, skill order, special notes]
  - **Strengths:** [List]
  - **Weaknesses:** [List]
  - **Simulated Damage or run speed:** [Value or range]
