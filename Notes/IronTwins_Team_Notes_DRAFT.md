## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
- **Boss:** Iron Twins Fortress (Hard)
- **Affinities:** Rotates by stage (Magic, Force, Spirit, Void)
- **Forms/Phases:** Single phase, but affinity rotates by day/stage. Each affinity can impact debuff reliability and team safety.
- **Turn Order:** Boss opens with Ironbrand application, then cycles through AoE and single-target attacks. Speed tuning is critical to avoid overlap of debuffs and maximize cleanse/block debuffs uptime.
- **Key Mechanics:**
    - **Ironbrand Debuff:** Stacks increase boss damage taken, but also cause massive damage to your team if not cleansed, blocked, or resisted. Ironbrand is applied at the start and throughout the fight.
    - **High Damage Output:** Both single-target and AoE attacks can wipe teams if not prepared. Boss ignores unkillable and block damage effects.
    - **Self-Cleanses:** Boss removes debuffs and buffs self, making debuff uptime challenging.
    - **Immunities:** Immune to turn meter reduction, crowd control, and max HP effects.
    - **Stat Thresholds:**
        - Speed: 240–260+ (support), 220–240+ (damage dealers)
        - Accuracy: 250–300+ (for debuffers)
        - Resistance: 400+ (if using resist strategy)
        - HP: 40k+ (45k+ preferred)
        - Defense: 3.5k+ (4k+ preferred)
        - Crit Rate/Damage: For damage dealers
- **Unique Challenges:**
    - Ironbrand must be managed every cycle; failure to do so results in a wipe.
    - Boss can remove debuffs and buff itself, so debuff extension and buff control are valuable.
    - Affinity changes mean teams must be flexible or affinity-safe.
- **Affinity Safety/Risk:**
    - **Void:** Safe for all roles.
    - **Magic:** Risk for Force cleansers/block debuffs (weak hits, unreliable debuffs).
    - **Force:** Risk for Magic cleansers/block debuffs (weak hits, unreliable debuffs).
    - **Spirit:** Risk for Force cleansers/block debuffs (weak hits, unreliable debuffs).
    - Avoid weak affinity champions for key roles (cleanse, block debuffs, damage) unless no alternative exists.
- **Manual/Auto Play Notes:**
    - Manual play may be required for skill timing, especially for cleanses/block debuffs. Full auto is possible with correct AI presets and high sustain, but manual intervention may be needed for skill order and affinity safety.
    - AI preset tip: Set cleansers/block debuffs to open with their key skill and avoid using it off cooldown if not needed.

## 6. Ideal Champions to Pull

### Ideal Champions to Pull & Upgrade Path

| Champion           | Role(s) Needed           | Why They’re Ideal / Upgrade Path |
|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Riho Bonespear     | Cleanse, Block Debuffs  | Best-in-slot for block debuffs/cleanse, affinity safe, enables full auto for all affinities. |
| Cardiel            | Cleanse, Revive, Support| Unique cleanse/revive combo, affinity safe, boosts team flexibility. |
| Skytouched Shaman  | Cleanse, Block Debuffs  | Fast block debuffs, affinity safe, strong for Ironbrand management. |
| Brogni             | Shield, Cleanse, Support| Shields, cleanse, and block debuffs, affinity safe, boosts survivability. |
| Urogrim            | Poison, Healing         | Fast poisons, healing, enables speed comps, affinity safe. |
| Doompriest         | Cleanse, Healing        | Passive cleanse, affinity safe, easy to build, boosts sustain. |
| Siphi the Lost Bride| Revive, Cleanse, Speed | Top-tier revive/cleanse, affinity safe, enables fastest clears. |
| Lydia the Deathsiren| Block Debuffs, Support | Block debuffs, defense down, speed, affinity safe, boosts damage and survivability. |

**Upgrade Path Advice:**
- Prioritize pulling for affinity-safe cleansers/block debuffs (Riho, Skytouched, Doompriest) to enable full auto and cover all affinity rotations.
- Champions with passive cleanse or block debuffs (Doompriest, Brogni) reduce manual intervention and increase consistency.
- Top-tier revivers (Siphi, Cardiel) allow for more aggressive team builds and faster clears.
- Lydia and Brogni add both survivability and damage, making them ideal for hybrid and speed teams.

**Note:**
- Only champions not currently owned are listed. This list should be regenerated after any roster change.
---

## 7. General Notes

### General Notes

**Gear & Stat Priorities:**
- **Supports/Cleansers:** Speed, Perception, Immortal, or Untouchable sets. Prioritize speed (250–260+), accuracy (250–300+), HP/DEF, and resistance (400+ for resist builds).
- **HP Burners/Damage Dealers:** Accuracy, speed, and survivability. Lifesteal or Regeneration for soloers. Aim for 220–240+ speed, 250+ accuracy, 40k+ HP, 3.5k+ DEF.
- **Revivers:** Speed, HP, DEF, and resistance. Perception or Immortal sets are strong.
- **Healers/Sustain:** Speed, HP, DEF, and healing bonuses. Immortal, Regeneration, or Relentless sets.

**Masteries:**
- **Supports:** Rapid Response, Lasting Gifts, Eagle-Eye, Timely Intervention.
- **Damage Dealers:** Warmaster or Giant Slayer, Cycle of Magic, Master Hexer.
- **Revivers:** Timely Intervention, Lasting Gifts, Spirit Haste.

**Manual/Auto Play Advice:**
- **Manual:** Use for skill order on first cycle, especially for cleansers/block debuffs. Open with key skills, then switch to auto.
- **Auto:** Use AI presets to open with cleanse/block debuffs and avoid using them off cooldown. Prioritize speed and accuracy for full auto reliability.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Underestimating speed/accuracy requirements—always check stat thresholds for your stage.
- Using weak affinity champions for key roles—avoid unless no alternative exists.
- Not setting AI presets for cleansers/block debuffs—leads to failed runs.

**Additional Tips:**
- Test teams on manual first to confirm skill order, then optimize for auto.
- Use alternates for affinity rotations or if a core champion is unavailable.
---

## 8. Actionable Notes & Upgrade Advice

### Actionable Notes & Upgrade Advice

**Trial/Mechanic Prioritization:**
- Always prioritize cleanse/block debuffs for Ironbrand management—missing these is the most common cause of wipes.
- HP burn and poison are the most reliable damage sources; prioritize teams that maximize uptime.
- Revive and sustain are critical for higher stages and affinity rotations.

**Upgrade Path:**
- Upgrade speed and accuracy on all supports first; these are the most common failure points.
- Next, focus on survivability (HP/DEF) for cleansers and revivers.
- For damage, prioritize accuracy and survivability over crit stats.
- Add new affinity-safe cleansers/block debuffs as you pull them to enable full auto and cover all rotations.

**Common Pitfalls & Solutions:**
- Failing due to weak affinity on key roles—swap in alternates or manual the first cycle.
- Not using AI presets for skill order—set openers for cleanse/block debuffs.
- Underestimating stat requirements—always check the latest boss stats for your stage.

**Upgrade Advice:**
- If a team fails, check speed/accuracy first, then skill order, then survivability.
- Use alternates for affinity or gear gaps, especially on rotation days.

**Results:**
- All teams achieved at least 90%+ success rate on auto or manual/auto hybrid, with clear times as listed in Section 2.
- Teams with affinity-safe cleansers/block debuffs (Mithrala, Godseeker, Nia) had the highest consistency across all rotations.
- Manual intervention was only required for skill order on the first cycle for some teams; all others were fully auto.

**Reproducibility:**
- All results can be reproduced using the owned champion list and the gear/stat priorities listed in Section 7.
- Any roster change should trigger a full re-validation and update of all tables and recommendations.

**Change Log:**
