# Iron Twins Fortress Teams (Owned Champions Only) — DRAFT PLAN (v3)

## Plan for Generating New Iron Twins Notes (DRAFT)

This plan outlines the step-by-step process for generating a new, standards-compliant Iron Twins Fortress guide. The new draft will:
- Use the structure of the FINAL file
- Follow the canonical template (`Boss_Guide_Template.md`)
- Reference the current owned champion list (`Owned_champion_list.md`)
- Be built step by step, with each section validated and cross-referenced

## 1. Table of Contents & Section Placeholders
- Draft a modular Table of Contents matching the FINAL and template
- Add anchor links for navigation
- List all required sections and subsections

## 2. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
- Summarize all Iron Twins mechanics, forms/phases, turn order, affinities, unique mechanics, stat/stat thresholds
- Cross-validate with RaidHQ, Ayumilove, HellHades, and in-game sources
- Add explicit affinity safety/risk notes (multi-line, per template)
- Document all sources

## 3. Teams by Estimated Damage/Clear Speed
- Propose 5–8 unique teams using only owned champions
- For each team, include: name, simulated damage/clear time, core champions, key mechanics, affinity safety/risk, manual/auto
- Add a quick reference table at the start

## 4. Detailed Team Sections (by Archetype)
- For each team:
    - List core roles, optimal combo, alternates, speed tuning, gear, masteries, manual/auto, strengths, weaknesses, simulated results, affinity safety/risk, actionable advice
    - Add trial/mechanic coverage and skill/turn order notes
    - Document alternates for each core role and trial/mechanic
    - Add troubleshooting notes for near-miss teams

## 5. Best Champions & Team Participation
- Table of top champions, their roles, and team participation
- Add trial/mechanic roles and affinity safety/risk columns

## 6. Direct Champion Comparisons by Role
- Compare only owned champions by key roles
- Add trial/mechanic coverage and affinity notes
- Clarify that only owned champions are included

## 7. Ideal Champions to Pull & Upgrade Paths
- List ideal champions to pull (not currently owned) and rationale
- Add upgrade path and team/trial impact for each

## 8. General Notes & Actionable Advice
- Gear, masteries, stat priorities, manual/auto advice
- Add common pitfalls, upgrade path, and trial prioritization

## 9. Validation, Simulation & Documentation
- Document all validation sources, simulation steps, and results (minimum 3 runs per team)
- Add a results table for all teams
- Explicitly state how affinity safety/risk was validated

## 10. Update & Maintenance Instructions
- Add instructions for updating the guide after a roster change
- State versioning and review policy

## 11. Troubleshooting & Near-Miss Teams
- Document teams that almost work but miss a trial/mechanic or damage threshold
- Add troubleshooting and upgrade path advice

## Next Steps
1. Create a new Markdown file for the draft notes
2. Populate each section step by step, following this plan
3. Validate each section with sources and simulation data
4. Review and update as new champions are acquired or strategies evolve

*This plan ensures the new Iron Twins guide will be modular, validated, and fully compliant with Copilot/AI agent standards. Each section will be generated and reviewed step by step for accuracy and completeness.*
