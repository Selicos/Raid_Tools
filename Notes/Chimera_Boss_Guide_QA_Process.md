# Chimera Boss Guide: QA Process & Workflow

## QA Section for Chimera Boss Notes Generation

**Question:** Should we fully document all Chimera boss mechanics, forms, and trial requirements before mapping champions, or do a quick mapping first to identify obvious gaps?
**Answer:** Yes, fully document the boss mechanic and other info. Map obvious gaps and prepare further analysis for team generation.

**Question:** Do you want to prioritize teams for maximum trial completion, raw damage, or a balance? (This affects how we sort and present teams.)
**Answer:** Maximize for each factor, focusing on trials and damage output, then advise on the recommendations overall. We can use different but overlapping teams in the runs we make.

**Question:** Should we simulate teams for all difficulties, or focus on Hard and above?
**Answer:** Focus on Normal, Hard, and the next levels of the boss. We want to use Hard as our current best difficulty for rewards but plan to scale higher.

**Question:** For each trial, do you want a table mapping all owned champions who can fulfill it, or just the best options?
**Answer:** Yes. Map the trials and all owned champions and their mechanic factors for completing trials. Use this chart as part of team setup when focusing on total trials completed. Be sure to offer advice and attack/skill order plus speed tuning if applicable for each set of trials. Also, list maximum trial success on lower difficulties if run ideally.

**Question:** Should we include a section for “trial-specific alternates” (champions who are only used to complete a specific trial, not for overall team strength)?
**Answer:** Yes, include this in the trial-focused team setup from the prior question.

**Question:** Do you want to see affinity safety/risk for each team per boss form, or just a summary per team?
**Answer:** Yes, affinity and other team details like speed tune, gear advice, mastery, and general champion role. Champions should have multiple roles defined as possible for this boss.

**Additional QA for Maximum Guide Quality:**
- **Combo Table:** For each trial, include a “combo” table showing which sets of champions can complete multiple trials together. Some trials require multiple buffs or damage types.
- **Trial Priority:** Include a “trial priority” (e.g., which trials are easiest to complete, or give the best rewards) to help with team selection. It may be impossible to get all, but try to maximize with currently owned champions.
- **Simulation Detail:** For team simulation, provide estimated turn-by-turn skill usage for maximizing trial completion, plus general advice on speed tune, turn order, or specific skill combos between teams to accomplish specific trials.
- **One-Key/Solo Strategies:** Highlight “one-key” or “solo” strategies if a single champion (owned or ideal pull) can trivialize a difficulty or trial. Optimize for chest rewards across difficulty, e.g., ignore higher difficulty if the best reward chest cannot be unlocked.
- **Alternates:** List a few alternates per team based on the owned champion list, but consider these teams when looking for ideal new champs to pull and use in them.
- **Team Upgrade Path:** Include a “team upgrade path” (e.g., if you pull X, swap Y for Z to unlock more trials/damage) as part of the ideal champs to pull section near the end.
- **Manual vs Auto:** For each team, provide a “manual vs auto” breakdown for trial completion and damage. Prefer auto for generic runs, but identify when manual is critical (e.g., for certain trial completion or key damage/buff combos to stay alive and keep doing a lot of damage).
- **Failures:** Document “failures” (e.g., teams that almost work but miss a trial or damage threshold) to help with troubleshooting and future upgrades. Include a few teams that do poorly at trials but very good at damage, especially for higher difficulties.
- **Quick Reference:** Provide quick reference tables or summaries at the start of sections for best teams by difficulty/trial/damage tier, as the amount of info may be large.

## Planning & Workflow Outline

### A. Research & Data Gathering
- Review authoritative Chimera boss guides (RaidHQ, Ayumilove, HellHades, in-game).
- Document all boss forms, turn order, affinities, unique mechanics, and trial types.
- List all possible trials and their requirements (buffs, debuffs, actions, etc).

### B. Champion & Trial Mapping
- Cross-reference your owned champion list with trial requirements (`input/owned_champions/owned_champion_list.md`).
- Identify which champions can provide each required buff, debuff, or mechanic. Prefer champions that can complete many trials in combo with other champions on the team while doing a lot of damage and surviving up to 65 turns.
- Note affinity safety/risk for each champion in each boss form.

### C. Team Building & Simulation
- Build 5–8 unique teams using only owned champions, maximizing:
  - Total damage output
  - Base damage output
  - Trial completion (to boost final score)
- For each team, specify:
  - Best difficulty (Normal, Hard, Brutal, etc.)
  - Estimated damage and trial completion (target: Hard, 4+ trials, 24M+ damage)
  - Auto/manual viability

### D. Guide Structure (Markdown, per template)
- Table of Contents (customized for Chimera)
- Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements (with affinity/trial notes)
- Teams by Estimated Damage/Trial Completion (table)
- Detailed Team Sections (core roles, alternates, speed, gear, masteries, strengths/weaknesses, simulated results, affinity safety/risk)
- Best Champions & Team Participation (table)
- Direct Champion Comparisons by Role (owned only)
- Ideal Champions to Pull (for missing trials/roles)
- General Notes, Actionable Advice, Validation & Simulation Notes

## Next Steps & Task Breakdown
1. Gather Chimera Boss Info: Forms, turn order, affinities, unique mechanics, trial types, stat thresholds.
2. Map Trials to Owned Champions: For each trial, list which owned champions can fulfill the requirement.
3. Draft Table of Contents & Section Placeholders: Prepare a new Markdown file structure for Chimera, based on the template.
4. Build & Simulate Teams: Propose 5–8 teams, sorted by damage, trial completion, and difficulty suitability.
5. Document Teams & Analysis: Fill in detailed team sections, tables, and notes.
6. Summarize Best Champions, Comparisons, and Pull Targets: Tables and lists per template.
7. Finalize Guide with General Notes & Validation: Add actionable advice, simulation notes, and sources.
