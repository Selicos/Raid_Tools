- ✅ Speed tuning explicit (champion order with rationale)

---

## Remaining Tasks (Optional)

### **High Priority:**
1. **Update Section 2 Table** - Add damage ranges for all difficulties in main team table (Normal/Hard/Brutal/Nightmare columns)
2. **Boss Mechanics Section** - Add difficulty breakdowns for each head mechanic (Decay cleanse frequency, Wrath Fury buildup, etc.)
3. **Difficulty Comparison Section** - Add new section comparing stat requirements and mechanic intensity across difficulties

### **Medium Priority:**
4. **Validation Notes Expansion** - Add simulation methodology details to Section 12
5. **Quick Reference Tables** - Add quick reference tables at start of guide for best teams by difficulty/trial/damage tier

### **Low Priority:**
6. **Best Champions Section** - Update participation counts after Set team changes
7. **Ideal Champions to Pull** - Re-validate after roster enhancements

## Next Steps

1. **Review v2_DRAFT** - User review of all enhancements
2. **Promote to FINAL** - Backup v1, rename v2_DRAFT to FINAL
3. **Git Commit** - Comprehensive commit message documenting all 18 teams enhanced
4. **Phase 3: Iron Twins** - Begin Iron Twins guide enhancements (10 teams, estimated 6-9 hours)

---

## Summary

**Phase 2 is substantially complete** with all 6 individual team sections fully enhanced (Speed Tuning, Manual/Auto Compromise, Turn-by-Turn, Affinity Safety/Risk) and Set teams using streamlined cross-reference format. The guide has nearly doubled in size (+98% increase from 558 to 1105+ lines) with comprehensive difficulty coverage (Normal/Hard/Brutal/Nightmare) for all teams.

The remaining optional tasks (Boss Mechanics expansion, Difficulty Comparison section, Section 2 table updates) can be completed in follow-up sessions or deferred to Phase 3 if time-constrained.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with v2_DRAFT review and promotion to FINAL, then begin Phase 3 (Iron Twins guide).
