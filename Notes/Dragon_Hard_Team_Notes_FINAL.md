## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements

### Manual/Auto Play Notes
- Most teams can run on full auto with correct AI presets, especially for boss stages. However, manual play may be required for:
  - Skill timing on waves (e.g., saving cleanse or shield for boss)
  - Affinity-specific tuning (e.g., avoiding weak affinity cleansers on Magic/Force stages)
  - Poison explosion teams (manual for fastest clears)
  - Early clears or undergeared teams (manual revive/cleanse timing)
- For tournament farming, manual play can optimize wave clear speed, but is not required for safe clears.

- **Boss:** Dragon (Dragon’s Lair, Hard Mode)
- **Affinities:** Rotates by stage (Magic, Force, Spirit, Void)
- **Key Mechanics:**
  - AoE attacks, places Poisons, and applies HP Burn (Scorch) to all.
  - Immune to Turn Meter reduction on Hard.
  - Only Poison and HP Burn deal significant damage.
  - High damage output; requires strong healing or shielding.
  - Stat thresholds: 250–300+ Accuracy, 220+ Speed, 3.5k+ DEF, 40k+ HP.
- **Affinity Safety/Risk:**
  - Void: Safe for all roles.
  - Magic: Risk for Force champions (weak hits).
  - Force: Risk for Magic champions (weak hits).
  - Spirit: Risk for Force champions (weak hits).
- **Special Notes:** On Hard, Dragon’s Scorch cannot be resisted; prioritize cleansing, healing, or block debuffs.

### General Notes
- **Gear:** Prioritize Speed, Accuracy, and survivability sets (Immortal, Regeneration, Lifesteal) for supports and debuffers. Damage dealers benefit from Savage, Cruel, or Lethal sets if survivability is sufficient.
- **Masteries:** Support/Defense trees for sustain and debuff extension; Offense tree for damage dealers. Key masteries: Warmaster/Giant Slayer (boss damage), Master Hexer (debuff extension), Lasting Gifts (buff extension).
- **Stat Priorities:**
  - Speed: 220+ for supports, 200+ for damage dealers (higher for speed teams)
  - Accuracy: 250–300+ for debuffers
  - HP/DEF: As high as possible for all roles
  - Crit Rate/Damage: For damage dealers only
- **Manual/Auto:** Most teams can run on full auto with correct AI presets, but manual play may be needed for skill timing or wave control on early clears.

## N+2. Ideal Champions to Pull
---

## General Notes

- Prioritize high accuracy (250–300+), speed (220+), and survivability (3.5k+ DEF, 40k+ HP).
- Use affinity-safe champions for key roles on each stage.
- Manual play may be needed for affinity-specific tuning or revive timing.
- For fastest clears, use wave nukers for waves and poison/HP Burn for boss.
- For safest clears, double up on revivers and healers.
- Gear: Poisoners/HP Burners in accuracy/speed, healers in Immortal/Relentless, nukers in Savage/Crit.
- Masteries: Warmaster/Giant Slayer for damage, support tree for healers/revivers.


**Top Poisoners:** Dracomorph, Tomb Lord, Xel'Toth (for more poison/DEF down options)
**Top HP Burners:** Sicia Flametongue (for HP Burn explosion), Tyrant Ixlimor
**Top Cleanse/Block Debuffs:** Duchess Lilitu, Siphi the Lost Bride
**Top Revivers:** Duchess Lilitu, Siphi, Raglin
**Top Wave Clear:** Kymar (reset), Trunda, Big 'Un
**Top DEF Down:** Lydia the Deathsiren, Dracomorph
**Other:** Seer (for speed farming), Kymar (reset), Prince Kymar

**Rationale:**  
These champions would enable faster clears, more affinity-safe runs, or allow for new team archetypes (unkillable, block damage, etc.).
