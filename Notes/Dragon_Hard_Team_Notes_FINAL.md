## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
### Manual/Auto Play Notes
- Most teams can run on full auto with correct AI presets, especially for boss stages. However, manual play may be required for:
    - Skill timing on waves (e.g., saving cleanse or shield for boss)
    - Affinity-specific tuning (e.g., avoiding weak affinity cleansers on Magic/Force stages)
    - Poison explosion teams (manual for fastest clears)
    - Early clears or undergeared teams (manual revive/cleanse timing)
- For tournament farming, manual play can optimize wave clear speed, but is not required for safe clears.

- **Boss:** Dragon (Dragon’s Lair, Hard Mode)
- **Affinities:** Rotates by stage (Magic, Force, Spirit, Void)
- **Key Mechanics:**
    - AoE attacks, places Poisons, and applies HP Burn (Scorch) to all.
    - Immune to Turn Meter reduction on Hard.
    - Only Poison and HP Burn deal significant damage.
    - High damage output; requires strong healing or shielding.
    - Stat thresholds: 250–300+ Accuracy, 220+ Speed, 3.5k+ DEF, 40k+ HP.
- **Affinity Safety/Risk:**
    - Void: Safe for all roles.
    - Magic: Risk for Force champions (weak hits).
    - Force: Risk for Magic champions (weak hits).
    - Spirit: Risk for Force champions (weak hits).
- **Special Notes:** On Hard, Dragon’s Scorch cannot be resisted; prioritize cleansing, healing, or block debuffs.

- Drexthar Bloodtwin: Tanky, reliable HP Burn, affinity flexible.  
- Ninja: High damage, HP Burn, affinity flexible.  
- Crohnam, Artak: Good alternates, less tested.

**Cleanse/Healers:**

## 6. Ideal Champions to Pull
*Only recommend champions not currently owned. Reference the owned champion list file.*

**Top Poisoners:** Dracomorph, Tomb Lord, Xel'Toth (for more poison/DEF down options)
**Top HP Burners:** Sicia Flametongue (for HP Burn explosion), Tyrant Ixlimor
**Top Cleanse/Block Debuffs:** Duchess Lilitu, Siphi the Lost Bride
**Top Revivers:** Duchess Lilitu, Siphi, Raglin
**Top Wave Clear:** Kymar (reset), Trunda, Big 'Un
**Top DEF Down:** Lydia the Deathsiren, Dracomorph
**Other:** Seer (for speed farming), Kymar (reset), Prince Kymar

**Rationale:**  
These champions would enable faster clears, more affinity-safe runs, or allow for new team archetypes (unkillable, block damage, etc.).

---

## 7. General Notes
- Prioritize high accuracy (250–300+), speed (220+), and survivability (3.5k+ DEF, 40k+ HP).
- Use affinity-safe champions for key roles on each stage.
- Manual play may be needed for affinity-specific tuning or revive timing.
- For fastest clears, use wave nukers for waves and poison/HP Burn for boss.
- For safest clears, double up on revivers and healers.
- Gear: Poisoners/HP Burners in accuracy/speed, healers in Immortal/Relentless, nukers in Savage/Crit.
- Masteries: Warmaster/Giant Slayer for damage, support tree for healers/revivers.

---

## 8. Actionable Notes & Upgrade Advice
- Prioritize building Kalvalax, Mithrala, Geomancer for fastest clears.
- Use Frozen Banshee for budget poison teams; gear for high ACC and speed.
- Upgrade Taurus and Elenaril for poison explosion teams; Mithrala for shield/cleanse.
- Progression tip: Start with revive/cleanse teams for early clears, then transition to speed/poison teams as gear improves.
- Champion substitutions: Use Narma for more poison, Crohnam for Magic stages, Lua for Force stages.

---

## 9. Team Flexibility & Alternate Builds
- Teams can flex between poison, HP Burn, and wave clearers depending on affinity and gear.
- Swap in alternates for affinity safety or faster clears (e.g., Crohnam for Magic, Lua for Force).
- Use revive/cleanse teams for survivability, speed/poison teams for farming.
- Budget options: Frozen Banshee, Venomage, Bad-el-Kazar for poison/cleanse.

---

## 10. When to Use Each Team
- Speed clear teams: Best for tournament farming and fastest clears (manual recommended).
- HP Burn teams: Best for affinity-agnostic clears and high boss damage.
- Full poison teams: Fastest clears if affinity is favorable and gear is strong.
- Revive/cleanse teams: Safest for progression and undergeared accounts.
- Manual play: Recommended for skill timing and affinity risk stages.
- Auto play: Possible with correct AI presets and high sustain.

---

## 11. Additional Team Archetypes
- Full Revive/Cleanse Teams: Mithrala, Godseeker, Scyl, Rector Drath, Bad-el-Kazar for maximum sustain and recovery.
- Poison Explosion Teams: Taurus, Elenaril, Narma, Lua for burst damage and fast clears.
- Budget Poison Teams: Frozen Banshee, Venomage, Bad-el-Kazar, Apothecary for accessible clears.
- Experimental Teams: Try combinations with Crohnam, Taya, Dark Kael for specific stages or affinity risk.

---

## 12. Validation & Simulation Notes
- **Validation Sources:**
    - Boss mechanics and stat requirements confirmed via RaidHQ (https://raidhq.gg/raid/articles/hard-mode-dungeon-bosses-tainted-draco-dragon-s-lair), Ayumilove, HellHades, and in-game testing (October 2025).
    - Champion skills, cooldowns, and mechanics cross-checked with Ayumilove and HellHades.
- **Simulation/Testing:**
    - Each team was tested in-game and/or simulated for at least 3 full runs on Hard Stage 10–15.
