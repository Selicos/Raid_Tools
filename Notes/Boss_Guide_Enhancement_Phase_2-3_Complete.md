- **Speed:** 240-260+ (support), 220-240+ (damage dealers)
- **Accuracy:** 250-300+ (debuffers)

- **Optional:** Commit Hydra + Iron Twins to git
- **Future Phases:** Apply same enhancement pattern to remaining boss guides (Dragon, Fire Knight, Spider, Ice Golem, Clan Boss, Shredder, etc.)

---

## Enhancement Standards Applied

### 1. Speed Tuning & Turn Order
- Explicit champion ordering (Champion1 → Champion2 → Champion3...)
- Speed requirements per champion (e.g., "250-260 SPD")
- Rationale for turn order (why each champion goes in that position)

### 2. Manual/Auto Compromise
- Quantified clear times for manual vs auto
- Damage ranges or trial completion rates
- Failure rate percentages (e.g., "10% failure rate")
- Specific guidance on when to manual vs auto

### 3. Turn-by-Turn Skill Usage
- Phase-by-phase breakdowns (Phase 1: Turns 1-15, Phase 2: Turns 16-35, etc.)
- Expected total turns for full clear
- Specific skill usage per champion per phase
- Boss health percentages at key phases

### 4. Multi-line Affinity Safety/Risk
- **Hydra:** Per-difficulty affinity risk (Normal/Hard/Brutal/Nightmare)
- **Iron Twins:** Per-sister affinity risk (Sister of Iron Magic vs Sister of Steel Force)
- Explicit champion-by-champion affinity analysis
- Backup plans for weak affinity champions
- Overall risk assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)

---

## Quality Validation

### Cross-Validation Sources:
- **RaidHQ** (primary for boss mechanics)
- **Ayumilove** (champion skills, gear recommendations)
- **HellHades** (team compositions, tier lists)

### Grep Search Confirmation:
- ✅ Chimera: 12+ matches for all enhancement keywords
- ✅ Hydra: 20+ matches for all enhancement keywords
- ✅ Iron Twins: 20+ matches for all enhancement keywords

### File Growth Validation:
- ✅ Chimera: 441 → 719 lines (+63%)
- ✅ Hydra: 558 → 1105 lines (+98%)
- ✅ Iron Twins: 394 → 582 lines (+48%)

## Next Actions

**For User:**
1. Review all three FINAL.md files to confirm enhancements meet standards
2. Delete v1_backup files after confirmation (or keep for reference)
3. Delete v2_DRAFT files after promotion confirmed
4. Decide: Commit Hydra + Iron Twins to git, or defer

**For Future Enhancement Phases:**
- Apply same pattern to remaining boss guides
- Estimated effort: ~30-45 minutes per team for full enhancement
- Prioritize based on user's active boss progression

**Completion Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Enhancement Pattern:** Fully documented and repeatable for future boss guides
