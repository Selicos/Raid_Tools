## Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
- **Boss: Hard Spider (Spider’s Den, Hard Mode)**
- **Affinity:** Hard Spider can be Force, Magic, or Spirit affinity. Affinity impacts TM control, nukers, and survivability.
  - **Force:** Risk for Magic nukers (e.g., Coldheart, Royal Guard).
  - **Magic:** Risk for Force champions; can reduce damage or survivability.
  - **Spirit:** Risk for key supports if weak affinity; Spirit spiderlings can inflict more poisons.
- **Key Mechanics:**
  - Immune to HP Burn (Hard mode only)
  - Summons spiderlings that can inflict Poison and HP Burn
  - High resistance and defense; requires high accuracy for debuffs
  - TM reduction and crowd control are highly effective
  - Cleanses debuffs periodically
- **Required Stats:**
  - Accuracy: 350–400+ (for debuffs/TM control)
  - Speed: 220–250+ (for consistent TM cycling)
  - HP%/DEF%: As high as possible for survivability
  - Cleanse/Heal: Strongly recommended
- **Special Notes:**
  - Manual play is recommended for TM control and poison explosion teams to maximize burst and survivability

## Key Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements

- **Boss: Hard Spider (Spider’s Den, Hard Mode)**
- **Key Mechanics:**
- **HP Burn Immunity:** On Hard Mode, *Skavag is immune to HP Burn* and will heal if HP Burn is applied.
- **Frequent Spiderling Summons:** Spiderlings spawn regularly and deal **heavy single-target damage**, often focusing on the lowest HP champion. They also apply **Poisons**, which stack quickly.
- **Healing from Spiderling Deaths:** On certain stages, *Skavag heals when spiderlings die*, making AoE nukes risky.
- **High Base Stats:** The boss has **extremely high HP, Defense, and Resistance**, requiring strong debuff accuracy and survivability.
- **Turn Meter Control & Crowd Control:** *Skavag is vulnerable to Turn Meter reduction and crowd control*, making Coldheart, Alure, and AoE stunners highly effective.
- **STrategy notes:**
  - Avoid HP Burners — they heal the boss on Hard Mode.
  - Use **crowd control**, **provokes**, or **taunts** to delay spiderling damage.
  - **Cleanse & Heal** are essential to counteract Poison stacking.
  - **Turn Meter Control** is highly effective — Coldheart, Alure, Armiger excel.
  - Manual play may be required to time spiderling kills and avoid boss healing.
  - Revivers and emergency healers are valuable for recovery after spiderling bursts.
- **Required Stats:**
  - Accuracy: 350–400+ (for debuffs/TM control)
  - Speed: 220–250+ (to cycle skills before spiderlings move)
  - HP/DEF: High for sustain/support
  - Resist: 350+ (for support/cleanser if aiming to resist poisons)
  - Enemy MAX HP: High value for boss nuking (Coldheart, Royal Guard, Septimus)
  - Cleanse/Heal: Strongly recommended

## Best Champions & Team Participation

| Champion           | Role(s)                        | Best Teams (Sample)                                         | Notes |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
---

## General Team-Building Notes (Hard Spider)

- All teams require high SPD/ACC/HP%/DEF% on core champions.
- Manual play is recommended for TM control and poison explosion teams to maximize burst and survivability.
- Use DeadwoodJedi or similar calculators for exact speed tuning if pushing for fastest clears.
- Prioritize Warmaster and Master Hexer masteries for all damage dealers and extenders.
- Relentless sets can greatly increase damage but introduce RNG.
- For poison explosion teams, careful skill cycling and debuff management are critical for success.
- If struggling with survivability, prioritize Brogni, Godseeker Aniri, and Tagoar for shields, revive, and cleanse.
- For speed farming, invest in multiple Coldhearts and Royal Guard if available.

---

## Actionable Notes & Upgrade Advice

- If you have only one Coldheart, focus on hybrid TM control/poison teams for best results.
- With two or more Coldhearts, prioritize double/triple MAX HP nuke teams for fastest clears.
- Taurus-based poison explosion teams are best for burst clears but require high accuracy and careful timing.
- If you lack Brogni, use Mithrala or Maulie Tankard for shield/support, but expect lower survivability.
- If you lack Tagoar, use Mithrala or Mausoleum Mage for cleanse, but be aware of poison risk from spiderlings.
- For revive insurance, always include Godseeker Aniri or Rector Drath in progression teams.
- Upgrade priorities: Coldheart (multiple copies), Brogni, Godseeker Aniri, Tagoar, Royal Guard, Venomage, Fayne, Taurus, Narma the Returned.

---

## Team Flexibility & Alternate Builds

- All teams can flex between poison, TM control, and sustain depending on available champions and gear.
- If you have strong Relentless sets, use them on Coldheart, Venomage, Fayne, and Godseeker Aniri for more skill cycles.
- For progression, use double revive teams (Godseeker + Rector) for maximum safety.
- For speed farming, use as many Coldhearts and Royal Guards as possible, with Brogni/Tagoar for support.
- If you have Mithrala, she can replace Brogni or Tagoar in most teams for shield/cleanse.

---

## When to Use Each Team

- Use triple/double Coldheart teams for fastest clears and tournament farming.
- Use Taurus poison explosion teams for burst clears if you have high accuracy and skill cycling.
- Use hybrid poison/TM control teams for reliable clears with less gear/stat requirements.
- Use full sustain/recovery teams for progression, auto-farming, or if struggling with survivability.
