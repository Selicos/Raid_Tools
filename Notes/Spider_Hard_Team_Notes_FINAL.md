## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
**Boss:** Hard Spider (Spider’s Den, Hard Mode)
**Affinities:** Rotates by stage (Force, Magic, Spirit)
**Key Mechanics:**
    - **HP Burn Immunity:** Skavag is immune to HP Burn and will heal if HP Burn is applied.
    - **Frequent Spiderling Summons:** Spiderlings spawn regularly, deal heavy single-target damage, and apply Poisons.
    - **Healing from Spiderling Deaths:** On certain stages, Skavag heals when spiderlings die, making AoE nukes risky.
    - **High Base Stats:** Extremely high HP, Defense, and Resistance; requires strong debuff accuracy and survivability.
    - **Turn Meter Control & Crowd Control:** Skavag is vulnerable to TM reduction and crowd control; Coldheart, Alure, and AoE stunners are highly effective.
    - **Periodic Debuff Cleanse:** Boss cleanses debuffs periodically.
    - **Stat Thresholds:**
        - Accuracy: 350–400+ (for debuffs/TM control)
        - Speed: 220–250+ (for consistent TM cycling)
        - HP: 40k+ (45k+ preferred)
        - Defense: 3.5k+ (4k+ preferred)
        - Resistance: 350+ (for support/cleanser if aiming to resist poisons)
        - Enemy MAX HP: High value for boss nuking (Coldheart, Royal Guard, Septimus)
**Affinity Safety/Risk:**
    - Void: Safe for all roles.
    - Force: Risk for Magic nukers (e.g., Coldheart, Royal Guard).
    - Magic: Risk for Force champions; can reduce damage or survivability.
    - Spirit: Risk for key supports if weak affinity; Spirit spiderlings can inflict more poisons.
**Special Notes:**
    - Avoid HP Burners — they heal the boss on Hard Mode.
    - Use crowd control, provokes, or taunts to delay spiderling damage.
    - Cleanse & Heal are essential to counteract Poison stacking.
    - Turn Meter Control is highly effective — Coldheart, Alure, Armiger excel.
    - Manual play may be required to time spiderling kills and avoid boss healing.
    - Revivers and emergency healers are valuable for recovery after spiderling bursts.

### Manual/Auto Play Notes
- Manual play is recommended for TM control and poison explosion teams to maximize burst and survivability. Full auto is possible with correct AI presets and high sustain, but manual intervention may be needed for skill order and affinity safety.

---

## 7. General Notes
- All teams require high SPD/ACC/HP%/DEF% on core champions.
- Manual play is recommended for TM control and poison explosion teams to maximize burst and survivability.
- Use DeadwoodJedi or similar calculators for exact speed tuning if pushing for fastest clears.
- Prioritize Warmaster and Master Hexer masteries for all damage dealers and extenders.
- Relentless sets can greatly increase damage but introduce RNG.
- For poison explosion teams, careful skill cycling and debuff management are critical for success.
- If struggling with survivability, prioritize Brogni, Godseeker Aniri, and Tagoar for shields, revive, and cleanse.
- For speed farming, invest in multiple Coldhearts and Royal Guard if available.

---

## 8. Actionable Notes & Upgrade Advice
- If you have only one Coldheart, focus on hybrid TM control/poison teams for best results.
- With two or more Coldhearts, prioritize double/triple MAX HP nuke teams for fastest clears.
- Taurus-based poison explosion teams are best for burst clears but require high accuracy and careful timing.
- If you lack Brogni, use Mithrala or Maulie Tankard for shield/support, but expect lower survivability.
- If you lack Tagoar, use Mithrala or Mausoleum Mage for cleanse, but be aware of poison risk from spiderlings.
- For revive insurance, always include Godseeker Aniri or Rector Drath in progression teams.
- Upgrade priorities: Coldheart (multiple copies), Brogni, Godseeker Aniri, Tagoar, Royal Guard, Venomage, Fayne, Taurus, Narma the Returned.

---

## 9. Team Flexibility & Alternate Builds
- All teams can flex between poison, TM control, and sustain depending on available champions and gear.
- If you have strong Relentless sets, use them on Coldheart, Venomage, Fayne, and Godseeker Aniri for more skill cycles.
- For progression, use double revive teams (Godseeker + Rector) for maximum safety.
- For speed farming, use as many Coldhearts and Royal Guards as possible, with Brogni/Tagoar for support.
- If you have Mithrala, she can replace Brogni or Tagoar in most teams for shield/cleanse.

---

## 10. When to Use Each Team
- Use triple/double Coldheart teams for fastest clears and tournament farming.
- Use Taurus poison explosion teams for burst clears if you have high accuracy and skill cycling.
- Use hybrid poison/TM control teams for reliable clears with less gear/stat requirements.
- Use full sustain/recovery teams for progression, auto-farming, or if struggling with survivability.

---

## 11. Additional Team Archetypes
- **Spiderling Control/CC Teams:** Maulie Tankard, Scyl of the Drakes, Archmage Hellmut. Focus on controlling spiderlings with provoke, stuns, or turn meter manipulation to reduce incoming damage and poison stacks.
- **Full Cleanse/Block Debuffs Teams:** Mithrala, Mausoleum Mage, Tagoar. Prioritize cleanse and block debuffs to counteract poison stacking and spiderling debuffs.
- **Niche/Experimental Teams:** Loki the Deceiver, Embrys, Sun Wukong. Test unique mechanics or experimental strategies for specific stages or affinity rotations.
