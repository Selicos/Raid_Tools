### Option B: Move to Iron Twins Guide (Phase 2)

## User Decision Point

**Question:** Should we:
1. **Complete Chimera Teams 4-6** now (1-2 hours), then move to Iron Twins?
2. **Move to Iron Twins Guide** now (Phase 2), and circle back to Chimera Teams 4-6 later?
3. **Add Medium-Priority enhancements** to Chimera first (Quick Reference expansion, form/phase guidance)?

**Recommendation:** Option 1 - Complete Chimera Teams 4-6 now for a fully polished Phase 1 deliverable, then proceed to Iron Twins with proven patterns.
