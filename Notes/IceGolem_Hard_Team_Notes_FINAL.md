## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
- **Boss:** Ice Golem (Hard Mode)
- **Affinities:** Rotates by stage (Magic, Force, Spirit, Void)
- **Key Mechanics:**
    - **Frigid Vengeance:** Massive AoE nuke triggered when minions die or boss HP drops by 10% increments. Can instantly wipe teams if not prepared.
    - **Minion Revive:** Minions revive if not killed together; out-of-sync kills can trigger multiple Frigid Vengeance activations.
    - **Debuffs:** Boss and minions place Decrease ACC, Freeze, and Heal Reduction. Freeze can lock out cleansers or revivers.
    - **Turn Meter Immunity:** Immune to all TM reduction on Hard mode—TM control is not viable.
    - **High Retaliation Damage:** Boss hits extremely hard on retaliation, especially after Frigid Vengeance. Survivability is critical.
    - **Stat Thresholds:**
        - Accuracy: 250–300+ (for debuffers)
        - Speed: 220+ (higher for healers/cleansers)
        - Defense: 3.5k+ (4k+ preferred)
        - HP: 40k+ (45k+ preferred for non-revivers)
        - Resistance: 250+ (optional, for block debuff/cleanse teams)
- **Affinity Safety/Risk:**
    - Void: Safe for all roles.
    - Magic: Risk for Force champions (weak hits, reduced healing/damage, unreliable debuffs).
    - Force: Risk for Magic champions (weak hits, unreliable debuffs, cleanses may fail).
    - Spirit: Risk for Force champions (weak hits, unreliable debuffs, cleanses may fail).
- **Special Notes:**
    - Cleanse, block debuffs, and revive are highly valuable. Prioritize champions who can remove Freeze/Decrease ACC or block them entirely.
    - Avoid triggering Frigid Vengeance with AoE nukes or killing minions out of sync—focus on controlled, single-target damage for minions.
    - HP Burn and Poison are strong, but avoid excessive AoE that can trigger boss passive.
    - Speed and sustain are more important than raw damage; out-speeding the boss and cycling heals/cleanses is key.
    - Manual play may be required for minion kill timing and skill order, especially on early clears.
    - Revivers and emergency healers are highly recommended for recovery after Frigid Vengeance.

### Manual/Auto Play Notes
- Manual play is recommended for minion kill timing and skill order, especially on early clears or budget teams.
- Full auto is possible with correct AI presets and high sustain, but manual intervention may be needed for minion control and recovery after Frigid Vengeance.
