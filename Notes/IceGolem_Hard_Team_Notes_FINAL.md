## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements

- **Boss:** Ice Golem (Hard Mode)
- **Affinities:** Rotates by stage (Magic, Force, Spirit, Void)
- **Key Mechanics:**
  - **Frigid Vengeance:** Massive AoE nuke triggered when minions die or boss HP drops by 10% increments. Can instantly wipe teams if not prepared.
  - **Minion Revive:** Minions revive if not killed together; out-of-sync kills can trigger multiple Frigid Vengeance activations.
  - **Debuffs:** Boss and minions place Decrease ACC, Freeze, and Heal Reduction. Freeze can lock out cleansers or revivers.
  - **Turn Meter Immunity:** Immune to all TM reduction on Hard mode—TM control is not viable.
  - **High Retaliation Damage:** Boss hits extremely hard on retaliation, especially after Frigid Vengeance. Survivability is critical.
  - **Stat Thresholds:**
    - Accuracy: 250–300+ (for debuffers)
    - Speed: 220+ (higher for healers/cleansers)
    - Defense: 3.5k+ (4k+ preferred)
    - HP: 40k+ (45k+ preferred for non-revivers)
    - Resistance: 250+ (optional, for block debuff/cleanse teams)
- **Affinity Safety/Risk:**
  - **Void:** Safe for all roles.
  - **Magic:** Risk for Force champions (weak hits, reduced healing/damage, unreliable debuffs).
  - **Force:** Risk for Magic champions (weak hits, unreliable debuffs, cleanses may fail).
  - **Spirit:** Risk for Force champions (weak hits, unreliable debuffs, cleanses may fail).
- **Special Notes:**
  - Cleanse, block debuffs, and revive are highly valuable. Prioritize champions who can remove Freeze/Decrease ACC or block them entirely.
  - Avoid triggering Frigid Vengeance with AoE nukes or killing minions out of sync—focus on controlled, single-target damage for minions.
  - HP Burn and Poison are strong, but avoid excessive AoE that can trigger boss passive.
  - Speed and sustain are more important than raw damage; out-speeding the boss and cycling heals/cleanses is key.
  - Manual play may be required for minion kill timing and skill order, especially on early clears.
  - Revivers and emergency healers are highly recommended for recovery after Frigid Vengeance.

Magic: Risk for Force counter. Force: Risk for Magic supports. Spirit: Risk for Force counter. |
