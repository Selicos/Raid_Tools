## Boss Mechanic Differences

### Shade Counter Accumulation

| Source | Normal (Stage 1-10) | Normal (Stage 11-20) | Normal (Stage 21-25) | Hard (Stage 1-10) | Hard (Stage 11-20) | Hard (Stage 21-25) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Weak Hit | +2 stacks | +4 stacks | +6 stacks | +4 stacks | +6 stacks | +8 stacks |
| Boss Crit | +5 stacks | +5 stacks | +5 stacks | +7 stacks | +7 stacks | +7 stacks |
| Enfeeble Cleanse | +2 stacks | +2 stacks | +2 stacks | +3 stacks | +3 stacks | +3 stacks |

**Impact:** Hard difficulty punishes mistakes more severely. A single weak hit on Stage 25 adds +8 Shade Counter (vs +6 Normal), and boss crits add +7 (vs +5 Normal). This makes Shade Counter management significantly harder.

### Shade Counter Thresholds (Same for Both Difficulties)

| Stacks | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 20+ | Immune to Poison damage |
| 30+ | Also immune to HP Burn and Smite damage |
| 40+ | Also immune to MAX HP-scaling damage |
| 50+ | Ignores 100% of target's DEF (unkillable threshold) |

## Champion Awakening Requirements

### Normal Difficulty Awakening Thresholds

- **Stages 1-10:** Level 1-2 Awakening viable (basic -2 Shade Counter per skill)
- **Stages 11-15:** Level 3-4 Awakening recommended (-4/-7 Shade Counter per 3-hit skill)
- **Stages 16-20:** Level 4-5 Awakening recommended (-7/-8 Shade Counter per 3-hit skill)
- **Stages 21-25:** Level 5-6 Awakening optimal (-8/-10 Shade Counter per 3-hit skill)

### Hard Difficulty Awakening Thresholds

- **Stages 1-10:** Level 3-4 Awakening recommended (L1-2 insufficient for Hard)
- **Stages 11-15:** Level 4-5 Awakening required (-7/-8 Shade Counter per 3-hit skill)
- **Stages 16-20:** Level 5-6 Awakening required (-8/-10 Shade Counter per 3-hit skill)
- **Stages 21-25:** **Level 6 Awakening mandatory** (-10 Shade Counter per 3-hit skill, L5 barely viable)

**Key Difference:** Hard difficulty requires Awakening Level 5-6 for stages 20+, while Normal can manage with L3-4 (though L5-6 is optimal).

---

## Affinity Safety/Risk Comparison

### Normal Difficulty Affinity Risk

- **Weak affinity champions:** 30% weak hit rate (adds +6 Shade Counter on Stage 21-25)
- **Affinitybreaker Set:** Recommended but not mandatory for most teams
- **Weak affinity on critical roles:** Risky but manageable with backup plans

### Hard Difficulty Affinity Risk

- **Weak affinity champions:** 30% weak hit rate (adds +8 Shade Counter on Stage 21-25)
- **Affinitybreaker Set:** **Mandatory for weak affinity damage dealers** (Ninja on Spirit stages)
- **Weak affinity on critical roles:** High risk, may cause team wipe if Shade Counter exceeds 45+

**Key Difference:** Affinitybreaker Set transitions from "recommended" on Normal to "mandatory" on Hard for weak affinity champions in critical roles (Ninja on Spirit stages).

---

## Manual/Auto Play Requirements

### Normal Difficulty

- **Stages 1-14:** Auto-friendly with proper team composition (Team 2, Team 4)
- **Stages 15-20:** Manual recommended but auto possible with high gear
- **Stages 21-25:** Manual required for optimal results

### Hard Difficulty

- **Stages 1-12:** Auto-friendly ONLY with Team 2 (100% Void team)
- **Stages 13-15:** Manual required (AI cannot handle Shade Counter management)
- **Stages 16-25:** Manual mandatory (auto = team wipe due to Shade Counter mismanagement)

**Key Difference:** Hard difficulty requires manual play 2-3 stages earlier than Normal. Team 2 is the only auto-viable option on Hard (stages 1-12 only).

---

## Gear Quality Requirements

### Normal Difficulty

- **Gear Level:** +12 on boots/gloves/chest acceptable for stages 1-15, +16 recommended for 16-25
- **Accessories:** +12 acceptable, +16 optimal
- **Substats:** Good substats helpful but not critical

### Hard Difficulty

- **Gear Level:** **+16 on ALL slots mandatory** for stages 13+
- **Accessories:** **+16 mandatory** (Ring, Amulet, Banner)
- **Substats:** High-quality substats required (Speed, HP%, DEF%, Accuracy, Resistance)
- **Affinitybreaker Set:** **Mandatory for weak affinity damage dealers** (4-piece set)

**Key Difference:** Hard difficulty has zero tolerance for under-geared champions. All gear must be +16 for stages 13+.

## Testing Framework Adjustments

### Normal Difficulty Testing Focus

- **Phase 1 (Team Validation):** Test on Stages 10-12
- **Phase 2 (Affinity Safety):** Test on Stages 15, 19, 23
- **Phase 3 (High-Stage Progression):** Test on Stages 20-25
- **Phase 4 (Auto-Friendly):** Test on Stages 10-20 (Teams 2, 4)
- **Phase 5 (Results Documentation):** Update guide with actual results

### Hard Difficulty Testing Focus

- **Phase 1 (Team Validation):** Test on **Stages 15-18** (higher baseline for Hard)
- **Phase 2 (Affinity Safety):** Test on **Stages 19, 23** (critical affinity stages)
- **Phase 3 (High-Stage Progression):** Test on **Stages 20, 25** (endgame Hard stages)
- **Phase 4 (Auto-Friendly):** Test **Team 2 ONLY on Stages 1-12** (all other teams manual required)
- **Phase 5 (Results Documentation):** Document Shade Counter peaks (expected 30-50 stacks on Hard vs 15-25 Normal)

## Key Takeaways: When to Use Each Guide

### Use Normal Difficulty Guide If:
- Your champions have **Awakening Levels 3-5** (not yet maxed)
- Your gear is mostly **+12 to +16** (not fully optimized)
- You prefer **auto farming** for stages 1-20
- Your debuffers have **200-250 Accuracy** (standard endgame gear)
- You're progressing through stages 1-25 for the first time

### Use Hard Difficulty Guide If:
- Your champions have **Awakening Levels 5-6** (near-maxed or maxed)
- Your gear is **all +16** (fully optimized with high-quality substats)
- You're comfortable with **manual play** for stages 13-25
- Your debuffers have **300-350 Accuracy** (top-tier gear)
- You're farming stages 20-25 for Superior Extracts and leaderboard ranking

## Summary: Major Hard Difficulty Challenges

1. **Shade Counter accumulates 33-50% faster** (+8 per weak hit vs +6, +7 per boss crit vs +5)
2. **Boss deals 50-75% more damage** (requires +10-20k HP, +800-1,500 DEF)
3. **Debuffs require +100-150 Accuracy** to land reliably
4. **Manual play required 2 stages earlier** (Stage 13 vs Stage 15 on Normal)
5. **Awakening Level 5-6 mandatory for stages 20+** (L3-4 insufficient)
6. **Team 4 cannot clear stages 21-25** (Scyl L3 insufficient for Hard)
7. **Affinitybreaker Set mandatory for weak affinity damage dealers** (Ninja on Spirit stages)
8. **Clear times 30-50% longer** (3:30 vs 2:45 for Team 1)
9. **All gear must be +16** for stages 13+ (no under-geared champions tolerated)
10. **Success rates 10-30% lower** (more RNG, less margin for error)
