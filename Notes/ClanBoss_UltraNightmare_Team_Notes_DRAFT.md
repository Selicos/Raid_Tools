### Extra Team Variants (Owned Champions Only)

- **Geomancer + Brogni Hybrid (HP Burn + Shields):**
  - *Core Champions:* Geomancer (HP Burn, damage dealer), Brogni (shields, reflect, support), Deacon Armstrong (TM boost, DEF down), Godseeker Aniri (buff extension, revive), Venomage (poison, DEF down)
  - *Mechanics:* Blends HP Burn burst with Brogni survivability. Run manual to time shields before large boss AOEs. Geomancer provides HP Burn reflect damage, Brogni shields mitigate AOE.
  - *Roles:* Geomancer (HP Burn, damage), Brogni (shield, support), Deacon (TM boost, DEF down), Godseeker (revive, extension), Venomage (poison, debuff)

- **Brogni 1:1 Unkillable:**
  - *Core Champions:* Brogni (shields, reflect), Maulie Tankard or Hotatsu (TM boost/DEF up/leech), Godseeker Aniri (revive, extension), Venomage (poison, DEF down), Rector Drath (revive, support)
  - *Mechanics:* Easier to build, targets consistent 80M+ with conservative tuning and full-auto due to heavy sustain. Brogni shields and Godseeker revive keep team alive.
  - *Roles:* Brogni (shield, support), Maulie/Hotatsu (TM boost, DEF up, leech), Godseeker (revive, extension), Venomage (poison, debuff), Rector (revive, support)

- **Seeker-led 2:1 Poison:**
  - *Core Champions:* Seeker (TM boost, support), Godseeker Aniri (revive, extension), Fayne (poison, weaken), Venomage (poison, DEF down), Frozen Banshee (poison)
  - *Mechanics:* Use Seeker for TM consistency when Deacon is occupied; good auto option if tuned. High poison uptime.
  - *Roles:* Seeker (TM boost), Godseeker (revive, extension), Fayne (poison, weaken), Venomage (poison, debuff), Frozen Banshee (poison)

- **Double Revive + Geomancer:**
  - *Core Champions:* Godseeker Aniri (revive, extension), Rector Drath (revive, support), Geomancer (HP Burn, damage), Venomage (poison, DEF down), Deacon Armstrong (TM boost, DEF down)
  - *Mechanics:* Geomancer adds HP Burn while double revive covers wipe risk on Spirit. High safety for auto runs.
  - *Roles:* Godseeker (revive, extension), Rector (revive, support), Geomancer (HP Burn, damage), Venomage (poison, debuff), Deacon (TM boost, DEF down)

- **Counterattack Hybrid (if Skullcrusher is pulled):**
  - *Core Champions:* Geomancer or Brogni (damage, shield), Skullcrusher (counterattack), Godseeker Aniri (revive, extension), Venomage (poison, DEF down), Fayne (poison, weaken)
  - *Mechanics:* Leverages reflect/counters to scale damage with less direct stat investment. Niche but can be fun and effective.
  - *Roles:* Geomancer/Brogni (damage, shield), Skullcrusher (counterattack), Godseeker (revive, extension), Venomage/Fayne (poison, debuff)

### Additional Mechanics to Exploit

- Make a sacrificial “slow” champion that is non-critical so Spirit’s slow/stun targets don’t break core roles (e.g., avoid Geomancer/Brogni/revivers as slowest).
- Use Godseeker Aniri timing (manual extension before boss AOE) to preserve buffs/shields across cycles.
- Prioritize Perception/Accuracy on all debuffers to ensure 230+ ACC; buff extenders should have Lasting Gifts where useful.
- Relentless on poisoners/TM boosters only if you can accept RNG variance; otherwise Perception + Speed for reliability.
- Reserve books for Geomancer, Brogni, Godseeker first to increase uptime and reduce manual headache.

### Actionable Checklist for Reliable 80M+ Runs

- **Primary:** Geomancer / Deacon Armstrong / Godseeker Aniri / Venomage / Fayne (1:1 Hybrid, most reliable for 80M+ with modest tuning)
- **Backup (auto-first):** Brogni / Deacon Armstrong / Godseeker Aniri / Venomage / Rector Drath (1:1 Shield/Reflect, safest for auto)
- **Speed/Stat Targets:**
  - Geomancer: ~260 SPD (2:1) or 250 SPD (1:1)
  - DPS poisoners: 240–255 SPD
  - ACC: 230+ on Fayne/Venomage/Frozen Banshee
  - DEF: 4.2k+, HP: 70k+ on shield/HP-scaling champs
- **Sets/Masteries:** Perception/Speed on extenders & debuffers; Warmaster + Master Hexer on DPS; Lasting Gifts on Godseeker optional
- **Manual vs Auto:** Manual recommended for highest output; 1:1 auto is acceptable for reliable 80M
