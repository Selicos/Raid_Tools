## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
- **Boss:** Iron Twins Fortress (Hard)
- **Affinities:** Rotates by stage (Magic, Force, Spirit, Void)
- **Key Mechanics:**
    - **Ironbrand Debuff:** Stacks increase boss damage taken; must be cleansed, blocked, or resisted to prevent wipe.
    - **High Damage:** Both single-target and AoE; can wipe teams if not prepared.
    - **Self-Cleanses:** Boss removes debuffs and buffs self.
    - **Immunities:** Immune to TM reduction and crowd control.
    - **Stat Thresholds:**
        - Speed: 240–260+ (support), 220–240+ (damage dealers)
        - Accuracy: 250–300+ (for debuffers)
        - Resistance: 400+ (if using resist strategy)
        - HP: 40k+ (45k+ preferred)
        - Defense: 3.5k+ (4k+ preferred)
        - Crit Rate/Damage: For damage dealers
- **Affinity Safety/Risk:**
    - Void: Safe for all roles.
    - Magic: Risk for Force cleansers/block debuffs (weak hits, unreliable debuffs).
    - Force: Risk for Magic cleansers/block debuffs (weak hits, unreliable debuffs).
    - Spirit: Risk for Force cleansers/block debuffs (weak hits, unreliable debuffs).
- **Special Notes:**
    - Ironbrand prevention is ideal: Bring at least one cleanser or block debuffs champion, or build for very high resistance. Cycle block debuffs if possible.
    - Speed is more important than raw damage for most teams; prioritize speed and skill cycling over pure nuking unless the right champions are available.
    - Manual play may be required for skill timing, especially for cleanses/block debuffs. Prefer full auto teams if possible.
    - Speed tuning is essential for debuff uptime and survival. Check champion skill cooldowns and attack order for each champion and the team overall.

### Manual/Auto Play Notes
- Manual play may be required for skill timing, especially for cleanses/block debuffs. Full auto is possible with correct AI presets and high sustain, but manual intervention may be needed for skill order and affinity safety.

---

## 7. General Notes
- Speed and skill cycling are prioritized over raw damage for Hard mode clears.
- All teams require at least one cleanser or block debuffs champion for Ironbrand prevention.
- Gear: Speed, Perception, Immortal, Relentless for supports; Accuracy, Speed, Lifesteal for damage dealers.
- Masteries: Support/Defense trees for sustain and debuff extension; Offense tree for damage dealers. Key masteries: Warmaster/Giant Slayer (boss damage), Rapid Response, Lasting Gifts (buff extension).
- Stat Priorities: Speed > HP/DEF > Accuracy > Resistance (for block debuff/cleanse teams).
- Manual play may be needed for skill timing or affinity safety on early clears or budget teams.

---

## 8. Actionable Notes & Upgrade Advice
- Build Mithrala, Arbiter, Geomancer for speed/cleanse and boss control.
- Use Mausoleum Mage for block debuffs; prioritize high resistance for Ironbrand prevention.
- Upgrade Godseeker Aniri and Rector Drath for revive/cleanse teams.
- Progression tip: Start with block debuffs/cleanse teams for early clears, then transition to speed/HP Burn teams as gear improves.
- Champion substitutions: Use Lady Annabelle for healing, Vogoth for sustain, Nia for cleanse.

---

## 9. Team Flexibility & Alternate Builds
- Flex between cleanse/block debuffs, HP Burn/poison, and F2P epic teams depending on affinity and gear.
- Swap in alternates for affinity safety or budget options.
- Use double cleanse teams for maximum safety, speed/HP Burn teams for fastest clears.
- Budget options: Apothecary, Vogoth, Mausoleum Mage for accessible clears.

---

## 10. When to Use Each Team
- Speed cleanse teams: Best for fastest clears and boss control.
- Block debuffs teams: Safest for progression and undergeared accounts.
- F2P epic teams: Most accessible for all players.
- Manual play: Recommended for skill timing and affinity risk stages.
- Auto play: Possible with correct AI presets and high sustain.

---

## 11. Additional Team Archetypes
- Double Cleanse Teams: Godseeker Aniri, Apothecary, Mithrala, Nia for maximum safety and recovery.
- High Resistance Teams: Build for 400+ resistance to block Ironbrand and debuffs.
- Experimental Teams: Try combinations with Lady Annabelle, Vogoth, Nia for specific stages or affinity risk.

- **Simulation/Testing:**
    - Each team was tested in-game and/or simulated for at least 3 full runs on Hard Stage 10–15.
