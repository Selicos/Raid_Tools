## Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements
- **Boss:** Iron Twins Fortress (Hard)
- **Key Mechanics:**
  - High single-target and AOE damage
  - Applies **Ironbrand** debuff (each stack increases boss damage taken; must be cleansed, blocked, or resisted to prevent wipe)
  - Cleanses debuffs and buffs self
  - Immune to Turn Meter reduction and crowd control
  - **Affinity:** [Specify affinity for the current rotation; note if it changes. Affinity can make or break certain teams.]
  - [List any unique mechanics, e.g., block revive, reflect damage, etc.]
- **Required Stats:**
  - Speed: [Recommended range for your teams; speed is critical for skill cycling and survival]
  - Accuracy: [For debuffers]
  - Resistance: [If using resist strategy to block Ironbrand or debuffs; requires very high stats]
  - HP%/DEF%: [For survivability]
  - Crit Rate/Damage: [For damage dealers]
- **Special Notes:**
  - **Ironbrand prevention is ideal:** Bring at least one cleanser or block debuffs champion, or build for very high resistance. Cycle block debuffs if possible. Teams without this perform poorly at high levels. 
  - **Speed is more important than raw damage** for most teams; prioritize speed and skill cycling over pure nuking unless the right champions are available.
  - Affinity issues: [Note which champions are weak/strong vs. current affinity; avoid weak affinity cleansers or block debuffs]
  - Manual play may be required for skill timing, especially for cleanses/block debuffs. Prefer full auto teams if possible.
  - Speed tuning is essential for debuff uptime and survival. Check champion skill cooldown when checking speed tune advice and attack order for each champion and the team overall.

**General Notes:**
- All teams require at least one cleanser or block debuffs champion for Ironbrand prevention.
- Speed is critical: aim for 240–260+ on support, 220–240+ on damage dealers (adjust for gear and tune).
- HP burn and poison are the safest damage sources; avoid weak affinity damage dealers.
- Prioritize auto-friendly teams unless manual skill timing is required for block debuffs/cleanse.
- Use high-resist builds only if you can reach 400+ resistance (very gear intensive).
- Masteries: Support champions should take Rapid Response, Lasting Gifts; damage dealers should take Warmaster or Giant Slayer.
- Gear: Speed, Perception, Relentless, and Immortal sets are top choices for support; damage dealers can use Accuracy, Speed, or Lifesteal if needed.
