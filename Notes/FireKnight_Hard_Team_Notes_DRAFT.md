## 1. Boss Mechanics & Stat Requirements


### Validated Mechanics (Hard Mode)

- **Shield Count:** 21 hits required to break the shield (up from 12 in classic). Breaking the shield is essential to damage the boss.
- **Turn Meter Reduction Immunity:** Tainted Fyro is immune to all Turn Meter reduction except from Freeze debuffs. Each Freeze debuff reduces his TM by 15%.
- **Freeze is Critical:** Teams must bring reliable Freeze (ideally on A1 or with skill cooldown reduction/Relentless/Reflex) to control the boss's TM and prevent him from taking turns.
- **HP Burn Ineffective:** HP Burn does not deal damage to the boss.
- **Ally Attack > Counterattack:** Ally Attack is preferred for breaking the shield, as Counterattack/Reflect require the boss to take a turn (which is dangerous).
- **HP Loss on Shield Hits:** Each hit on the shield while it is up reduces your team's Max HP by 1%. If the boss takes a turn and puts the shield back up, you must break it again, losing more Max HP per hit. Avoid letting the boss take turns.
- **Boss Speed:** ~250 SPD on Stage 10 (higher on later stages). Teams must be fast and well-tuned.
- **Stat Requirements:**
  - Accuracy: 350+ (estimate for Stage 10+)
  - Speed: 250+ (to cycle skills and keep up with boss)
  - Resistance: 350-450 if needed (not usually a priority)
- **Awakened Champions:** Awakened champions take less damage and deal more, but team composition and mechanics are more important than awakening status.

### Affinity Safety/Risk
- Void: Safe for all roles.
- Force: Safe unless your main Freeze champion is Magic affinity.
- Magic: Risk if your main Freeze champion is Force affinity.
- Spirit: Risk if your slowest champion is a key role (e.g., Freeze, main revive, etc.); Spirit stun can break team cycle.

### Manual/Auto Play Notes
- Manual play is often required to time Freeze and shield breaks, especially if your Freeze is not on A1 or you lack skill cooldown reduction.
- Auto is possible with the right team (reliable A1 Freeze, Ally Attack, high speed, and good AI tuning).

---

**Validation:**
- Mechanics confirmed via RaidHQ (https://raidhq.gg/raid/articles/hard-mode-dungeon-bosses-tainted-fyro-fire-knight-s-castle), in-game testing, and community consensus (October 2025).
- Copilot instructions: For all future boss mechanic updates, validate with RaidHQ as a primary source if available, then cross-check with Ayumilove, HellHades, and in-game data.
