## Recommended Phase 2 Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Boss Ratings and champ reviews for New Champions

**Use authoritative sources:**
- RaidHQ: https://raid-hq.com/champions/[champion-name]
- Ayumilove: https://ayumilove.net/raid-shadow-legends-[champion-name]-skill-mastery-equip-guide/
- HellHades: https://hellhades.com/champions/[champion-name]/

**For each new champion, document:**
- Boss-specific ratings (X/5 or X/10)
- Key abilities (HP Burn, Decrease DEF, Cleanse, etc.)
- Unique mechanics (Unkillable, MAX HP damage, Poison explosion, etc.)
- Affinity (Magic, Force, Spirit, Void)
- Faction

For the Champion review, suggest and confirm a template. ensure that the template covers stats, mechanics, cheese options or pairings, viability overall, and suggestions on investment. We will want to ensure that recommendations for PVE content has a disclaimer about needing to book/etc the character. include mastery advice for specific content or roles, and other champions with similar utility. Follow existing instructions for format/etc. We will put these in the Champion review folder, with template in the Input dir. Once template is confirmed, we want to add a later task to generate this review for each owned champion using info from this project, instructions, and online feedback. ensure to validate against online sources as able. Ask questions about other info or recommended parts of the champion review guide template.

### Step 2: Create Priority Queue Report

**Format:**
| Champion | Rarity | Boss | Rating | Priority | Reason |
|----------|--------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| Lord Champfort | Legendary | Scarab King | 6/5 | CRITICAL | Passive shield = hard counter |
| Coldheart (x3) | Rare | Fire Knight | 6/5 | CRITICAL | Triple MAX HP cheese |
| Pain Keeper (x3) | Epic | Clan Boss UNM | 5/5 | CRITICAL | Triple unkillable cheese |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Step 3: Update Guides Systematically

**For each guide (starting with CRITICAL priority):**

If helpful, ask about my most used or strongest champs per role/etc, and use that to update guides. I can also provide preferences on mechanics or champs. EX, I love HP burn but it isn't always the best move and have champs built out for teams that use hp burn. My spider team is strong, but poison champs are not as well built ex frozen banshee, emaril, narma, etc.

1. **Section 2: Champion-to-Mechanics Mapping**
   - Add new champions to relevant mechanics tables
   - Note cheese potential in "Notes" column
   - Update gap analysis

2. **Section 3: Quick Reference Table**
   - Add new teams if applicable

3. **Section 4: Detailed Team Sections**
   - Create new team section OR update existing team
   - Document cheese strategy if duplicate champion enables it
   - Include all required fields (per Team_Entry_Template.md)

4. **Section 5: Best Champions & Team Participation**
   - Add new champions to participation table

5. **Section 6: Direct Champion Comparisons by Role**
   - Add new champions to comparison tables

6. **Section 7: Ideal Champions to Pull**
   - Remove now-owned champions
   - Reprioritize based on new gaps

7. **Section 9: Actionable Notes & Upgrade Advice**
   - Update upgrade paths with new champions

8. **Section 12: Validation & Simulation Notes**
   - Document new teams with minimum 3 test runs

Generate a set of recommended Arena teams, for Gold 3 up in  classic and for tag team in general. prefer safe but fast teams for tag team. For all, list limitations, substitute champs, etc similar to the boss guides. But, this is a more simple overview of options. I typicall lead in classic with wukong (buff strip, nuke, sometimes sheep for control), Mythrala (for buffs/cleanse plus more damage with hex), and Loki (for control, buff strip, but primarily blocking active skills to suppress mythics/etc). The last spot goes ot ninja, michelangelo, coldheart, or a support/healer champ like Godseeker Aniri, Arbiter, Rector Drath, etc.

## Questions for User

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Please answer these questions directly in this document, then notify me when ready to proceed.

---

### Section 1: Champion Review Template Configuration

**Purpose:** Create standardized template for individual champion reviews (`input/Champion_Review_Template.md`)

**Required Content Already Confirmed:**
- ✅ Stats, mechanics, cheese options/pairings
- ✅ Viability overall, investment suggestions
- ✅ PVE disclaimer (booking/building requirements)
- ✅ Mastery advice per content/role
- ✅ Similar champions with same utility
- ✅ Validation against online sources (RaidHQ, Ayumilove, HellHades)

**Additional Template Configuration Questions:**

1. **Rating Systems per Content Area:**
   - Should we include rating systems (X/10 or X/5) for each content area (Arena, Clan Boss, Hydra, Doom Tower, Dungeons, Faction Wars)?
   - **Your Answer:** X/10, but relate this to owned champions so a 10/10 with nothing to support it notes this

2. **Gear Recommendation Detail Level:**
   - How detailed should gear recommendations be?
     * **Option A:** Full artifact breakdown (Banner: Accuracy, Chest: HP%, Boots: Speed, Gloves: Crit Rate, Weapon/Helmet/Shield stats)
     * **Option B:** General sets only (Speed + Accuracy, Lifesteal + Speed, etc.)
     * **Option C:** Both general sets + detailed artifact recommendations
   - **Your Answer:** C, though keep this section from getting too long for champs without much use in guides/arena/etc

3. **Faction Wars Advice:**
   - Should we include faction wars specific advice for each champion (role in faction, synergies with faction members)?
   - **Your Answer:** YES, with current owned champs and similar to other guides ideal pull list for that faction (limit to 5 champs)

4. **Skill Priority Documentation:**
   - Should we include skill priority (which skills to book first, e.g., "A2 → A3 → A1" or "Books optional, low priority")?
   - **Your Answer:** List ideal order, but know that skill books are random. List if it is ideal to not book certain skill,s or how far to invest if not going all the way.

5. **Build Variations:**
   - Should we include early game vs late game build differences (e.g., "Early game: Focus on Speed/Accuracy, Late game: Add Crit Rate/Damage")?
   - **Your Answer:** No, focus on hard dungeons and mid-late game expansion and content. My clan is able to beat UNM each day so rewards are good.

6. **Other Sections:**
   - Are there any other sections you'd like in the champion review template?
   - **Your Answer:** Allow input section for how I've currently built the champ ex mastery generics, gear sets, and current stats/speeds/etc. Enable functionality for using this input for further spefic usage or recommended changes. EX, if I have a champ built for a lot of content that should focus in one important corner like clan boss, we want to advise on building them for recommended content based on the current status. 

---

### Section 2: Arena Team Recommendations Configuration

**Purpose:** Create simple overview guide for Arena teams (Gold 3+ Classic, Tag Team bronze 3 up (lower priori ty))

**Core Team Already Confirmed:**
- ✅ Wukong (buff strip, nuke, sheep)
- ✅ Mythrala (buffs/cleanse, hex damage)
- ✅ Loki (control, buff strip, suppress mythics)
- ✅ Flex: Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart, Godseeker Aniri, Arbiter, Rector Drath

**Arena Guide Configuration Questions:**

1. **Arena Tier Breakdown:**
   - Should we create separate sections for each Arena tier (Gold 3, Gold 4, Gold 5, Platinum)?
   - Or keep it general (Gold 3+ with notes on scaling to higher tiers)?
   - **Your Answer:** seperate advice by tier given common champs and mechanics. We will often lose the speed battel to go first, which will likely be a loss, in higher tiers unless we can build a tanky option, steal buffs and nuke early, or another gimmick

2. **Defensive Team Recommendations:**
   - Should we include defensive team recommendations as well (how to set up defense teams)?
   - **Your Answer:** Yes, with 3 variations and estimations on success in against common team setups for Arena.

3. **Live Arena Coverage:**
   - Should we include Live Arena advice (ban strategies, counter picks, draft order)?
   - **Your Answer:** Yes, though I'm not deep in this area and usually end up with a variation of my main Arena team with Arbiter as bait for bans, keeping wukong as speed lead. Embrys is not yet worked in or maxed due to book cost.

4. **Speed Tuning Requirements:**
   - Should we specify speed tuning requirements per tier (e.g., Gold 3 = 300+ SPD lead, Plat = 350+ SPD)?
   - **Your Answer:** Yes with general guidance based on tole and content type. do this for recommended content or areas where speed tune can really matter.

5. **Tag Team Detail Level:**
   - For Tag Team, should we provide 3 full team compositions or general guidance on building multiple teams?
   - **Your Answer:** Let's focus on 3 core teams, then a few variations or cheese teams. We don't care about defense in tag team

---

### Section 3: Guide Update Preferences & Priorities

**Purpose:** Understand your champion strengths and content focus to prioritize guide updates effectively

**User Preferences Already Noted:**
- ✅ HP Burn teams: Well-built, user prefers HP burn mechanics
- ✅ Poison teams: NOT well-built (Spider strong but Frozen Banshee/Elenaril/Narma weak)

**Guide Update Priority Questions:**

1. **Strongest Champions by Role:**
   - Please list your strongest/most-built champions for each role:
     * **HP Burn:** [e.g., Mordecai (confirmed), others?]
     * **Decrease DEF:** [e.g., Stag Knight? Dhukk? Warmaiden?]
     * **Support/Healer:** [e.g., Godseeker Aniri? Scyl? Rector Drath?]
     * **Damage Dealer (non-HP Burn):** [e.g., Ninja? Michelangelo? Geomancer?]
     * **Tank/Sustain:** [e.g., Vogoth (confirmed)? Others?]
     * **TM Control:** [e.g., Coldheart? Armiger?]
     * **Revive:** [e.g., Scyl? Arbiter? Rector Drath?]
     * **Cleanse:** [e.g., Reliquary Tender? Mausoleum Mage?]
   - **Your Answer:** Include this info in champion guide. May use for champion comparison (2+ champs as able).

2. **Active Content Focus:**
   - Which content are you farming most actively right now (in priority order)?
     * [ ] Dungeons (Dragon, Spider, Fire Knight, Ice Golem) - If yes, which dungeon(s)?
     * [ ] Doom Tower Hard (which bosses are priorities?)
     * [ ] Doom Tower Normal
     * [ ] Clan Boss UNM
     * [ ] Hydra Clan Boss
     * [ ] Iron Twins Fortress
     * [ ] Chimera
     * [ ] Arena (Classic/Tag/Live)
     * [ ] Faction Wars
   - **Your Answer:** 
     1. **Clan Boss UNM** (Priority 1)
     2. **Dungeons** (Priority 2 - all dungeons)
     3. **Other PVE with Advanced Rewards** (Priority 3 - Cursed City, etc.)
     4. **Arena** (Priority 4)
     5. **Faction Wars Normal** (Important - completed: Orc, Banner Lords, Barbarian, Dwarf; Near completion: Lizardmen, Knights Revenant, High Elf, Dark Elf)
   - **Note:** Champ-specific use cases (mechanics, dungeon/boss, wave clear) should be highlighted. Ask more questions on this as needed.

3. **Cheese Strategy Integration:**
   - Should cheese strategies (Triple Coldheart, Triple Pain Keeper, Double Nogdar) be:
     * **Option A:** Integrated into existing boss guides as additional team sections
     * **Option B:** Separate dedicated cheese strategy guide (Notes/Cheese_Strategies_Guide_FINAL.md)
     * **Option C:** Both (integrated + separate reference guide)
   - **Your Answer:** Consider a few cheese strats based on the champ being reviewed or compared. Highlight **SAFE** cheese builds for bosses and clan bosses. If a cheese build is strictly better in speed/damage/availability (especially for bosses requiring lots of damage like clan bosses), recommend it and ensure it is noted in the champ review AND that specific boss guide under archetypes. **Integration approach: Option A with strong emphasis in champ reviews.**

4. **Guide Update Priority:**
   - Which guides should we update first?
     * **Option A:** Lord Champfort guides (Scarab King CRITICAL 6/5, Iron Twins HIGH 5/5, Clan Boss MEDIUM 4/5)
     * **Option B:** Cheese strategy guides (Fire Knight x3 Coldheart CRITICAL 6/5, Clan Boss x3 Pain Keeper CRITICAL 5/5)
     * **Option C:** Systematic updates (all 15 guides, starting with CRITICAL priority, then HIGH, then MEDIUM)
     * **Option D:** Focus on your most active content (based on answer to question 2 above)
   - **Your Answer:** Prioritize: **Champion reviews first**, then updating **Clan Boss guides**, then **other bosses/content**, then other items with new champion information. (Hybrid of systematic + content-focused approach)

---

### Section 4: Champion Rating Priority & Data Collection

**Purpose:** Determine scope of external data lookups for 22 new champions

1. **Champion Rating Scope:**
   - Should I generate boss ratings for all 22 new champions now, or focus only on high-priority champions (Legendaries + duplicates for cheese)?
   - **Your Answer:** Generate for all new, and all without such ratings. 

2. **Affinity Field Addition:**
   - Should I add Affinity field to all 100 champions now (will require external lookups), or defer until needed for guide updates?
   - **Your Answer:** yes, do this before building champ reviews

3. **Faction Field Addition:**
   - Should I add Faction field to all 100 champions now (will require external lookups), or defer until needed?
   - **Your Answer:** yes, do this before building champ reviews

---

### Section 5: Workflow Selection

**Purpose:** Determine which workflow to start with (all can be done eventually, this is just the order)

**Option A: Champion Review Template (Recommended - Foundation for Everything)**
- Create comprehensive template in `input/`
- Generate 1-2 example reviews for new Legendaries (Lord Champfort, Fyt-gun Isable)
- Sets foundation for all future champion analysis
- **Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours (template + 2 examples)

**Option B: Arena Team Recommendations (Quick Win - High Daily Value)**

## 🔔 When You're Ready

**After filling in your answers above, please notify me with:**
- "Answers complete, proceed with [Workflow Letter]"
- Or ask any clarifying questions about the options

I'll then proceed with the selected workflow and use your answers to configure all templates and guides accordingly.

---

## Phase 2 Timeline Estimate

**Assuming systematic guide updates:**

| Task | Time Estimate |
|------|---------------|
| Generate boss ratings for 22 champions | 2-3 hours |
| Create priority queue report | 30 minutes |
| Update CRITICAL guides (Scarab King, Fire Knight, Clan Boss UNM) | 4-6 hours |
| Update HIGH priority guides (Iron Twins, Dragon, Ice Golem, Spider) | 4-6 hours |
| Update MEDIUM priority guides (remaining 8 guides) | 4-6 hours |
| Validation & testing | 1-2 hours |
| **Total Phase 2:** | **16-24 hours** |

**Note:** This is a substantial update. Recommend breaking into multiple sessions or focusing on highest-priority guides first.

---

## Ready for Your Direction

✅ **Phase 1 Complete:** Foundation validated, tools ready  
✅ **Owned Champion List:** Clean, alphabetized, 100 champions ready  
🔄 **Phase 2 Ready:** Waiting for user direction on priority and scope

Other points:
If instructions need updates for these workflows/guide types/etc, ensure they are updated appropriately. Use responses from asked questions here for that input.
Validate information when able, especially for base info like champ stats/mechanics and usefulness.
Prioritize instruction updates and all other changes to make this process repeatable for other new champions to create champion review, check boss content recommendations, and update those boss/etc guides with the recommended champion. 
The goal is a complete setup of guides and info for MY owned champions that can be cleared and rebuilt with any other account owned champ list. This should start as simply enabling single champion addition in chat or to the owned list, then working from there. We don't need to scale this to a whole new set of champs anytimes soon.
Update roadmap/etc for these changes and future updates/lookaheads
Ask questions in chat, present outcomes in chat, and show reviews/comparisons in chat. We want to only create files with QA, changelogs, etc if needed.
USe a DRAFT file when staging updates to existing documents/guides/reviews. then merge all info into the DRAFT, validate/verify, and with chat check and approval of changes mark the old FINAL as old and the new DRAFT as final. 

For all items, ensure workflow questions are answered and updates are made to instructions, always at the start of a phase or process if possible to ensure the new instructins are used for the phase. Prioritize this going forward.

when this file is processes, update chat vs prior workflow for this phase, list work, and begin
