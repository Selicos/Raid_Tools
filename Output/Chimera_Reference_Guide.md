✅ **Manual/Auto Compromise** - Quantified performance differences:
- Manual: Damage ranges, trials completed (e.g., "19-22M, 8-9 trials")
- Auto: Damage ranges, trials completed (e.g., "16-18M, 6-7 trials")
- Compromise: Explicit tradeoffs (e.g., "-15% damage, -2 trials")
- AI preset recommendations for auto play

✅ **Turn-by-Turn Skill Usage** - Phase-by-phase breakdowns (65-75 turns per team):
- Serpent/Lion/Dragon/Core form strategies
- Exact skill rotations (A1/A2/A3) per turn
- Trial completion checkpoints (e.g., "Poison trial complete by Turn 30")
- Manual targeting priorities for minion waves
- Trial priority lists (10 trials ranked by difficulty)

✅ **Affinity Safety/Risk** - Multi-line format per boss form:
