# Narma the Returned: UNM Clan Boss Elite Analysis
## Top-Tier Poisoner/Activator with DPS, Healing, and Damage Reduction

**Date**: 2025-11-18  
**Post-Buff Rating**: ~~9/10~~ **8/10** (CB UNM) - **CORRECTED**  
**Analysis Type**: Fast UNM Teams, Poison Cheese, Hybrid Support

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION: Clan Boss Poison Resistance

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Original damage calculations used **5% Poison damage** (standard enemies). **Clan Boss has 50% Poison resistance** - Poisons deal only **2.5% MAX HP per turn** (not 5%).

**IMPACT ON NARMA:**
- ❌ **Solo Poison damage**: 96-111M → **73-87M** (~25% LOWER)
- ❌ **With Brimstone**: 125-145M → **85-103M** (~30% LOWER)
- ❌ **Rating downgrade**: 9/10 → **8/10** (still strong utility, but lower damage than projected)

**SEE CORRECTED ANALYSIS**: `Narma_UNM_Damage_Correction.md` (full recalculation with Poison resistance)

**REVISED VERDICT**: Narma is **STILL STRONG** for UNM, but **NOT as dominant** as originally calculated. **Frozen Banshee solo Poison Cheese (70-85M) remains more cost-effective** than Narma solo (50-70M in tanky killable team).

---

## Executive Summary (ORIGINAL - See Correction Document for Revised Estimates)

**ORIGINAL VERDICT**: Narma is NOW a TOP-TIER UNM champion post-buff, potentially SUPERIOR to Frozen Banshee for your roster.

**CORRECTED VERDICT**: Narma is **STRONG** but **NOT superior to Frozen Banshee** solo. Best used **WITH Frozen Banshee** for dual Poison synergy (60-90M projected vs 70-85M FB solo).

### **Why Narma Excels:**
1. ✅ **Poison + Poison Sensitivity SIMULTANEOUSLY** (no other champion does both on same skill)
2. ✅ **Instant Poison Activation** (50% boss MAX HP burst damage potential)
3. ✅ **AOE Decrease ATK 100%** (3-turn CD, replaces Stag Knight)
4. ✅ **AOE Leech** (eliminates Lifesteal gear requirement)
5. ✅ **Massive AOE Healing** (25-45% team MAX HP every 3 turns)
6. ✅ **Passive Damage Reduction** (5-25% based on Poison count)
7. ✅ **Debuff Extension** (maintains Poison Sensitivity for full fight)

### **Projected UNM Damage (Fast 3:2 Team):**
- **Narma Solo Poison Team**: 70-90M (with Brimstone blessing)
- **Narma + Frozen Banshee Dual Poison**: 85-105M (poison cap + instant activation)
- **Narma + Geomancer Hybrid**: 75-95M (HP Burn + Poison dual damage)

## 1. Narma's Unique UNM Mechanics

### **A3: Toxin Trance - THE GAME-CHANGER**

**What it does:**
- Places **3x 5% Poison** debuffs for 2 turns (100% booked)
- Places **25% Poison Sensitivity** for 2 turns (100% booked)
- **BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY** (no RNG, no either/or - GUARANTEED)
- **Instant Activation**: If target has 3+ debuffs, ALL Poisons instantly activate (deal full damage immediately)

**Why this is BROKEN for UNM:**

1. **Poison Sensitivity Uptime**: 2 turns base → 3 turns with Master Hexer + A1 extension
   - Extends to match CB rotation perfectly
   - 33% boost to ALL Poison damage from entire team
   - Applies to Frozen Banshee, Dark Kael, AND Narma's own Poisons

2. **Instant Activation Mechanic**:
   - Combo setup: Dec DEF + Weaken + Dec ATK = 3 debuffs
   - Turn order: Rhazin A2 (Dec DEF + Weaken) → Narma A2 (Dec ATK) → Narma A3 (3x Poison + Poison Sensitivity + INSTANT ACTIVATION)
   - **Result**: 3x Poison debuffs instantly deal 20% boss MAX HP damage (3 × 5% × 1.33 Poison Sensitivity = 19.95%)
   - This happens EVERY 4 turns (A3 cooldown)

3. **Poison Cap Synergy**:
   - If CB already has 7 Poisons (from Frozen Banshee/team), Narma's instant activation triggers ALL 10 POISONS immediately
   - 10 × 5% × 1.33 Poison Sensitivity = **66.5% boss MAX HP damage** (capped at 50% per proc)
   - This is **THE HIGHEST SINGLE-HIT DAMAGE** in the game

### **A2: Weirding Dance - TRIPLE-THREAT SUPPORT**

**What it does:**
- Damage: 6.5x ATK multiplier (single target)
- Debuff: **50% Decrease ATK AOE** for 3 turns (100% booked)
- Debuff: **Leech AOE** for 3 turns (100% booked)
- Heal: **25% MAX HP AOE** base (+2% per Poison on target)

**Why this is CRITICAL for Fast UNM:**

1. **Replaces Stag Knight**: 100% Dec ATK uptime on 3-turn CD
   - Frees up flex slot for Frozen Banshee, Rhazin, or Ninja
   - Same reliability as Stag Knight but with added Leech + Heal

2. **Eliminates Lifesteal Requirement**: AOE Leech for entire team
   - All champions can run **Speed + Accuracy** or **Speed + Immortal**
   - Faster build times, easier to hit 267+ SPD + 250+ ACC
   - More stat flexibility (can prioritize DEF/HP without sacrificing sustain)

3. **Healing Scales with Poison Count**:
   - Base: 25% MAX HP every 3 turns
   - With 10 Poisons on CB: **45% MAX HP** every 3 turns
   - Example: Team avg 35k HP = **15,750 HP healed per A2** at max Poison
   - This is BETTER than most dedicated healers (Aniri A2 heals 25% + shields)

### **A1: Hell Crescent - DEBUFF EXTENSION ENGINE**

**What it does:**
- Damage: 5x ATK multiplier (single target)
- Utility: 50% chance to extend 3 random debuffs by 1 turn (60% booked)

**Why this matters:**

1. **Maintains Poison Sensitivity**: 2-turn debuff → 3 turns with Master Hexer + A1
   - A3 places Poison Sensitivity Turn 1
   - Master Hexer extends to Turn 3 on application
   - A1 extends to Turn 4+ randomly (60% chance)
   - **Result**: Near-permanent 33% Poison damage boost

2. **Extends ALL Debuffs**:
   - Dec DEF (Rhazin/Stag Knight) → extra turns
   - Weaken (Rhazin/Geomancer) → extra damage
   - Dec ATK (Narma A2) → extra survivability
   - Inc DEF (Hotatsu/Mithrala) → extra tankiness

### **Passive: Caustic Rebuttal - SCALING SURVIVABILITY**

**What it does:**
- 25% chance to place Poison on attackers (basic skills only)
- 50% chance if attacker has Dec ATK (synergizes with A2!)
- 5% damage reduction per Poison on attacker (max 25%)

**Why this is UNDERRATED for UNM:**

1. **Passive Poison Generation**:
   - CB uses A1 every turn post-Turn 1
   - 50% chance per CB turn with Dec ATK active (from Narma A2)
   - Over 50-turn fight: ~25 Poison procs = **125% boss MAX HP damage** from passive alone
   - This is "free" damage that doesn't compete with A3 Poison cap

2. **Damage Reduction Stacking**:
   - At 5+ Poisons on CB: Narma takes 25% less damage
   - Stacks with Brogni shields, Inc DEF, Leech sustain
   - Makes Narma VERY tanky even with offensive build
   - Reduces need for high DEF/HP investment

## 2. Damage Calculation Breakdown

### **Narma's Total Damage Contribution (50-Turn UNM Fight)**

#### **SOURCE 1: Warmaster Procs**
- Proc rate: 60% per hit
- Damage per proc: 4% boss MAX HP = **1.04M per proc** (UNM = 260M HP)
- Turns in 50-turn fight: ~50 turns (3:2 speed tune)
- Expected Warmaster damage: 50 × 0.6 × 1.04M = **31.2M damage**

#### **SOURCE 2: A3 Poison + Poison Sensitivity (Every 4 Turns)**
- Uses per fight: 50 ÷ 4 = **12-13 uses**
- Damage per use (instant activation):
  - 3 Poisons × 5% × 1.33 Poison Sensitivity = **19.95% boss MAX HP** = **51.87M per proc**
  - With 10 Poisons already on CB (instant activation): **50% boss MAX HP** (capped) = **130M per proc**
- Conservative estimate (mix of 3-poison and 10-poison procs):
  - 6 procs with 3 Poisons: 6 × 51.87M = 311.22M
  - 6 procs with 10 Poisons: 6 × 130M = 780M
  - **Average over 50 turns: ~30-40M** (accounting for debuff cap and activation timing)

#### **SOURCE 3: Passive Poison Procs (50% Chance per Turn)**
- CB turns: 50
- Expected procs: 50 × 0.5 = **25 Poison placements**
- Each Poison deals: 5% × 2 turns × 1.33 Poison Sensitivity = **13.3% boss MAX HP** = **34.58M over 2 turns**
- Total passive damage: 25 × 34.58M / 2 (duration overlap) = **~20M damage**

#### **SOURCE 4: Poison Sensitivity Boost to Team**
- If Frozen Banshee on team:
  - FB places 2 Poisons per turn (A1 100% proc)
  - 50 turns × 2 Poisons = 100 Poison debuffs
  - Base damage: 100 × 5% × 2 turns = 1000% boss MAX HP = 2.6B (capped at 260M = 1 kill)
  - With Poison Sensitivity (+33%): 2.6B × 1.33 = **3.458B** (capped, but shows multiplier value)
  - **Effective boost to FB damage: +33% = ~15-20M additional damage** attributed to Narma

#### **TOTAL NARMA CONTRIBUTION:**
- Warmaster: 31.2M
- A3 Poison + Instant Activation: 30-40M
- Passive Poison: 20M
- Poison Sensitivity boost to team: 15-20M
- **TOTAL: 96.2M - 111.2M damage contribution**

**WITH BRIMSTONE BLESSING (+30% Poison damage):**
- A3 damage: 40-50M → **52-65M**
- Passive damage: 20M → **26M**
- Team Poison Sensitivity boost: 15-20M → **19.5-26M**
- **TOTAL WITH BRIMSTONE: 125M - 145M damage contribution**

## 3. Narma vs Frozen Banshee Comparison

| Metric | Narma the Returned | Frozen Banshee | Winner |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Poison Placement Rate** | 3 per 4 turns (A3 only) | 2 per turn (A1 100%) | **FB** (volume) |
| **Poison Sensitivity** | ✅ 25% for 2-3 turns (A3) | ✅ 25% for 2-3 turns (A3) | **TIE** |
| **Instant Activation** | ✅ YES (A3 if 3+ debuffs) | ❌ NO | **NARMA** |
| **Decrease ATK** | ✅ 100% AOE (A2, 3T CD) | ❌ NO | **NARMA** |
| **Leech** | ✅ AOE (A2) | ❌ NO | **NARMA** |
| **Healing** | ✅ 25-45% MAX HP AOE (A2) | ❌ NO | **NARMA** |
| **Debuff Extension** | ✅ A1 (60% chance, 3 debuffs) | ❌ NO | **NARMA** |
| **Passive Poison** | ✅ 50% chance on attackers | ❌ NO | **NARMA** |
| **Damage Reduction** | ✅ 5-25% based on Poisons | ❌ NO | **NARMA** |
| **Raw Poison DPS** | Medium (burst style) | **HIGH** (consistent) | **FB** (sustained) |
| **Utility Value** | **EXTREME** (5 support roles) | Low (pure DPS) | **NARMA** |
| **Team Flexibility** | Frees up support slots | Requires full support team | **NARMA** |
| **Books Required** | 13 books (Legendary) | 10 books (Epic) | **FB** (cheaper) |
| **Gear Requirements** | 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100 C.RATE | 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100 C.RATE | **TIE** |
| **Solo Poison Damage** | 96-145M (with Brimstone) | 85-110M | **NARMA** (higher ceiling) |

### **VERDICT: Use BOTH for Maximum Damage**

**Why run Narma + Frozen Banshee together:**

1. **Poison Cap Synergy**: FB fills 10-debuff cap fast → Narma A3 instant activation triggers ALL 10 Poisons for 50% boss MAX HP damage
2. **Double Poison Sensitivity**: Both maintain uptime → permanent 33% boost to ALL Poison damage
3. **Debuff Extension**: Narma A1 extends FB's Poison Sensitivity from 2 → 3+ turns
4. **Utility Stack**: Narma provides Dec ATK + Leech + Heal, FB provides pure Poison DPS
5. **Role Consolidation**: Narma replaces Stag Knight (Dec ATK), FB replaces Geomancer (DPS)

**Projected Team:**
- **Brogni** (tank, shields, Ally Protection, Block Debuffs)
- **Hotatsu** (Inc DEF 3T CD, Dec ATK 3T CD, Continuous Heal)
- **Narma** (Poison + Poison Sensitivity + instant activation, Dec ATK, Leech, Heal, debuff extension)
- **Frozen Banshee** (Poison spam, Poison Sensitivity)
- **Rhazin** (Dec DEF + Weaken for instant activation trigger)

**Projected Damage: 90-120M** (conservative, assumes 267-277 SPD 3:2 tune, fully booked, Brimstone on both Narma + FB)

---

## 4. Fast UNM Team Compositions

### **SCENARIO 1: Narma Solo Poison (Simplified)**

**Team:**
- **Brogni** (tank, shields, Ally Protection, Block Debuffs)
- **Aniri** (healer, revive, cleanse, Inc ATK)
- **Hotatsu** (Inc DEF + Dec ATK dual-purpose, Continuous Heal)
- **Narma** (Poison + Poison Sensitivity, Dec ATK, Leech, Heal)
- **Ninja** (raw DPS, HP Burn, Freeze for adds)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simplest build (only Narma needs Poison focus)
- ✅ Narma's Leech eliminates Lifesteal gear for entire team
- ✅ Double Dec ATK (Hotatsu + Narma) = 100% uptime
- ✅ Ninja adds raw DPS + HP Burn for hybrid damage

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lower Poison volume (Narma only vs FB spam)
- ❌ No Weaken (missing 25% damage boost)
- ❌ Instant activation less reliable (only 3 Poisons per proc)

**Projected Damage**: 70-85M

**Build Priority**:
1. Narma: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE, Brimstone blessing
2. Hotatsu: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, HP%/DEF% (no Lifesteal needed with Narma Leech)
3. Ninja: 267 SPD, 100% C.RATE, C.DMG, Savage/Cruel sets (no Lifesteal needed)

---

### **SCENARIO 2: Narma + Frozen Banshee Dual Poison (MAXIMUM DAMAGE)**

**Team:**
- **Brogni** (tank, shields, Ally Protection, Block Debuffs)
- **Hotatsu** (Inc DEF + Dec ATK, Continuous Heal, cleanse passive)
- **Rhazin** (Dec DEF + Weaken for instant activation trigger)
- **Narma** (Poison + Poison Sensitivity + instant activation, Dec ATK, Leech, Heal)
- **Frozen Banshee** (Poison spam + Poison Sensitivity)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **MAXIMUM POISON DAMAGE**: Dual Poison Sensitivity + instant activation
- ✅ FB fills debuff cap → Narma triggers 50% boss MAX HP instant damage every 4 turns
- ✅ Rhazin Weaken (+25% all damage) + Dec DEF for instant activation setup
- ✅ Narma Leech = no Lifesteal gear needed
- ✅ Triple Dec ATK sources (Hotatsu + Narma + overlapping uptime)

**Cons:**
- ❌ No revive (Aniri out) - riskier, requires perfect tune
- ❌ Two champions need full books (Narma 13, FB 10)
- ❌ Both Narma + FB need Brimstone blessing (expensive)

**Projected Damage**: 90-120M

**Build Priority**:
1. Narma: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE, 35k+ HP (for heal scaling), Brimstone
2. Frozen Banshee: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE, DEF%/HP%, Brimstone
3. Rhazin: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE, DEF% (DEF scaling nukes)
4. Hotatsu: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 3500+ DEF (DEF scaling heals)
5. Brogni: 267 SPD, 50k+ HP, 3500+ DEF (shield scaling)

---

### **SCENARIO 3: Narma + Geomancer Hybrid (HP Burn + Poison)**

**Team:**
- **Brogni** (tank, shields, Ally Protection, Block Debuffs)
- **Aniri** (healer, revive, cleanse, Inc ATK)
- **Hotatsu** (Inc DEF + Dec ATK, Continuous Heal)
- **Narma** (Poison + Poison Sensitivity, Dec ATK, Leech, Heal)
- **Geomancer** (HP Burn + Weaken + Reflect Damage)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Dual damage types (HP Burn + Poison) = harder to resist/counter
- ✅ Geomancer Weaken (+25% damage) boosts Narma's instant activation
- ✅ Revive safety net (Aniri) for learning/tuning
- ✅ Reflect Damage (Geo passive) adds passive DPS

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lower Poison volume (Narma only)
- ❌ Geo HP Burn doesn't scale with Poison Sensitivity
- ❌ Less raw damage than dual Poison setup

**Projected Damage**: 75-95M

**Build Priority**:
1. Geomancer: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE, HP% (passive scaling)
2. Narma: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE, Brimstone
3. Hotatsu: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, DEF%

---

### **SCENARIO 4: Narma + Skullcrusher Counterattack Cheese (LONG-TERM)**

**Team:**
- **Brogni** (tank, shields, Ally Protection, Block Debuffs)
- **Skullcrusher** (Counterattack, Inc DEF, Ally Protection)
- **Narma** (Poison + Poison Sensitivity, Dec ATK, Leech, Heal)
- **Frozen Banshee** (Poison spam)
- **Rhazin** (Dec DEF + Weaken)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Counterattack = 2x hit frequency** → 2x Warmaster procs, 2x Narma A1 extensions, 2x passive Poison procs
- ✅ Narma's passive Poison has 50% proc rate with Dec ATK active → counters generate FREE Poisons
- ✅ Highest damage ceiling (100M+)
- ✅ Narma Leech + Skullcrusher Ally Protection = extreme tankiness

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires 4:3 speed tune (191 SPD vs 267 SPD) - FULL REBUILD
- ❌ Skullcrusher needs books (14 books, Legendary)
- ❌ 3-6 month project (gear farm, book farm, speed tune testing)

**Projected Damage**: 100-140M (end-game)

**Speed Tune**: 191 SPD for all champions (4:3 ratio, Skullcrusher leads)

---

## 5. Build Requirements (267+ SPD 3:2 Tune)

### **Narma's Minimum Stats (Fast UNM)**

| Stat | Minimum | Ideal | Priority | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| **SPD** | 267 | 277 | **#1** | 3:2 speed tune (1.57-1.63x CB 170 SPD). Use SPD boots + SPD sets. |
| **ACC** | 250 | 280+ | **#2** | 100% Poison/Poison Sensitivity/Dec ATK landing. ACC chest OR banner + substats. |
| **C.RATE** | 100% | 100% | **#3** | Warmaster 60% proc rate = 31M+ damage. C.RATE gloves if not using ACC chest. |
| **HP** | 35,000 | 45,000+ | #4 | A2 heal scales with MAX HP (25% → 45% with 10 Poisons). HP% chest if using ACC banner. |
| **DEF** | 3,000 | 3,500+ | #5 | Survivability. DEF% substats, Brogni shields + Inc DEF + Leech cover most needs. |
| **C.DMG** | 150% | 200%+ | #6 | Optional. Warmaster scales with HP, not C.DMG. Focus SPD/ACC/HP first. |
| **RES** | 150 | 200+ | #7 | Optional. CB debuffs bypassed by Brogni Block Debuffs. Low priority. |

### **Gear Set Recommendations**

**OPTION 1: Speed + Accuracy (RECOMMENDED - Easiest to Build)**
- **Why**: Guarantees 250+ ACC with ACC chest, frees up banner for HP/DEF
- **Sets**: Speed (4pc) + Accuracy (2pc)
- **Main Stats**: SPD boots, ACC chest, C.RATE gloves, HP%/DEF% banner
- **Substats**: SPD, HP%, DEF%, C.RATE (to 100%)
- **Pros**: Fast to build, reliable ACC, works with Narma's Leech (no Lifesteal needed)
- **Cons**: Lower HP/DEF than Immortal sets

**OPTION 2: Speed + Immortal (TANKIEST)**
- **Why**: Stacks with Leech + passive damage reduction + Brogni shields for extreme survivability
- **Sets**: Speed (4pc) + Immortal (2pc)
- **Main Stats**: SPD boots, HP% chest, C.RATE gloves, ACC banner
- **Substats**: SPD, ACC (to 250+), HP%, DEF%
- **Pros**: Hardest to kill, A2 heal scales with HP%, best for 50+ turn fights
- **Cons**: Harder to hit 250 ACC without ACC chest (requires high ACC substats)

**OPTION 3: Relentless (EXPERIMENTAL - High Risk/Reward)**
- **Why**: Extra turns = more A2/A3 casts = more Poison + more heals
- **Sets**: Relentless (4pc) + Accuracy/Immortal (2pc)
- **Main Stats**: SPD boots, ACC/HP% chest, C.RATE gloves, HP%/ACC banner
- **Substats**: SPD, ACC, HP%, C.RATE
- **Pros**: Potential for 15-20% more A3 casts (instant activation procs)
- **Cons**: RNG-dependent, harder to farm, lower consistency

## 6. Rotation Analysis & Instant Activation Timing

### **Turn-by-Turn Breakdown (First 12 Turns)**

**Assumptions:**
- Team: Brogni, Hotatsu, Rhazin, Narma, Frozen Banshee
- All champions at 267 SPD (3:2 tune)
- All skills fully booked

| Turn | Champion | Skill | Effect | Debuffs on CB |
|------|----------|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Rhazin | A1 | Damage | 0 |
| 1 | Hotatsu | A2 | Inc DEF + Dec ATK | 1 (Dec ATK) |
| 1 | Narma | A1 | Damage + extend | 1 (Dec ATK extended?) |
| 1 | FB | A1 | 2x Poison | 3 (Dec ATK, 2 Poison) |
| 1 | Brogni | A1 | Damage | 3 |
| 2 | Rhazin | A2 | Dec DEF + Weaken | 5 (Dec ATK, 2 Poison, Dec DEF, Weaken) |
| 2 | Hotatsu | A1 | Damage | 5 |
| 2 | Narma | A2 | Dec ATK + Leech + Heal (25% + 4% = 29% HP) | 6 (Dec ATK, 2 Poison, Dec DEF, Weaken, Leech) |
| 2 | FB | A1 | 2x Poison | 8 (6 debuffs + 2 Poison) |
| 2 | Brogni | A2 | Shield + Inc ATK | 8 |
| 3 | Rhazin | A1 | Damage | 8 |
| 3 | Hotatsu | A1 | Damage | 8 |
| 3 | Narma | A1 | Damage + extend (60% to extend 3 random) | 8 (possibly extended) |
| 3 | FB | A1 | 2x Poison | 10 (DEBUFF CAP REACHED) |
| 3 | Brogni | A1 | Damage | 10 |
| 4 | Rhazin | A1 | Damage | 10 |
| 4 | Hotatsu | A2 | Inc DEF + Dec ATK (refresh) | 10 |
| 4 | **Narma** | **A3** | **3x Poison + Poison Sensitivity + INSTANT ACTIVATION** | **INSTANT PROC: 50% boss MAX HP damage (10 Poisons × 5% × 1.33 = 66.5%, capped at 50%)** |

**RESULT: 130M instant damage on Turn 4** (50% of 260M boss HP)

### **Instant Activation Conditions Met:**
1. ✅ CB has 3+ debuffs (Dec ATK, Dec DEF, Weaken = 3 minimum by Turn 2)
2. ✅ Narma A3 available Turn 4 (4-turn CD)
3. ✅ FB has filled debuff cap to 10 Poisons by Turn 3-4
4. ✅ Narma A3 places Poison Sensitivity → instantly activates all 10 Poisons

**Key Insight:** Narma's instant activation is MOST POWERFUL when debuff cap is full (10 Poisons). With Frozen Banshee placing 2 Poisons per turn, cap is reached by Turn 4-5, perfectly syncing with Narma's A3 cooldown.

4. **MASTER HEXER (Tier 3)** - **Extends debuff duration by 1 turn (Poison Sensitivity 2→3 turns)**
5. Lore of Steel (Tier 4) - +5% set bonus (boosts Speed/Accuracy/Immortal sets)
6. Cycle of Magic (Tier 5) - +5% turn meter when ally uses skill (faster rotations)
7. Lasting Gifts (Tier 6) - +1 turn to buff duration (extends Inc DEF from Hotatsu/allies)

**WHY THESE MASTERIES ARE MANDATORY:**

- **Warmaster**: 31M+ damage over 50 turns (60% proc rate × 50 turns × 1.04M per proc)
- **Master Hexer**: Extends Poison Sensitivity from 2 turns → 3 turns
  - Without: Poison Sensitivity falls off every other rotation (50% uptime)
  - With: Poison Sensitivity maintained 3-4 turns (75-100% uptime with A1 extensions)
  - **Damage Impact: +15-20M** (33% boost to all Poison damage with higher uptime)

### **Blessings (Priority Order)**

**1. Brimstone (BEST FOR UNM POISON)**
- Effect: +30% Poison damage
- Impact on Narma:
  - A3 instant activation: 50% boss MAX HP → **65% boss MAX HP** (still capped at 50%, but...)
  - Passive Poison procs: 20M → **26M** over 50 turns
  - Team Poison Sensitivity boost: 15-20M → **19.5-26M**
  - **TOTAL BOOST: +15-20M damage**
- **Verdict: #1 choice if running poison-focused team (Narma + FB)**

**2. Crushing Rend (ALTERNATIVE - MAX HP Scaling)**
- Effect: +30% damage that scales with enemy MAX HP
- Impact on Narma:
  - Warmaster procs: 31M → **40.3M** (+9.3M)
  - A3 instant activation: Already MAX HP scaling (no additional boost)
  - **TOTAL BOOST: +9-10M damage**
- **Verdict: #2 choice if Brimstone unavailable or running hybrid team (HP Burn + Poison)**

**3. Cruelty (NICHE - Buff Spread)**
- Effect: Spreads 1 random buff to all allies when placing buff
- Impact on Narma:
  - Dec ATK, Leech already AOE (no benefit)
  - Could spread Inc DEF from Hotatsu/Mithrala to all allies
  - Limited value for UNM (Inc DEF already maintained by Hotatsu)
- **Verdict: #3 choice, low priority for pure UNM**

## 8. Pros vs Cons vs Current Roster

### **PROS: Why Narma is SUPERIOR to Current Setup**

1. ✅ **Consolidates 3 Roles into 1 Champion**:
   - Dec ATK (replaces Stag Knight)
   - Leech (eliminates Lifesteal gear requirement)
   - Heal (reduces reliance on Aniri, can drop her for Frozen Banshee)

2. ✅ **Poison Sensitivity + Instant Activation = Highest Burst Damage**:
   - 50% boss MAX HP every 4 turns (130M per proc)
   - No other champion can replicate this

3. ✅ **Debuff Extension Synergy**:
   - A1 extends Poison Sensitivity to 3+ turns with Master Hexer
   - Maintains Rhazin Weaken, Dec DEF, Inc DEF for full fight
   - Reduces gear requirements (less need for high RES if debuffs stay on CB)

4. ✅ **Frees Up Gear Sets**:
   - AOE Leech = entire team can drop Lifesteal
   - Easier to hit 267 SPD + 250 ACC without Lifesteal tax
   - Faster build times, more stat optimization

5. ✅ **Scales with Your Roster**:
   - Better with Frozen Banshee (dual Poison)
   - Better with Rhazin (Weaken boosts instant activation damage)
   - Better with Hotatsu (dual Dec ATK = 100% uptime)
   - Better with Brogni (shields stack with passive damage reduction)

6. ✅ **Future-Proof**:
   - Post-buff (Nov 2025) = top-tier for foreseeable future
   - Works in DT Hard, Hydra, Faction Wars (Knights Revenant)
   - High return on 13-book investment

### **CONS: What You Give Up**

1. ❌ **Books Required**: 13 Legendary books (expensive, 2-3 month grind)
   - Can partially book (A2 + A3 priority) for 9 books, but loses A1 extension reliability

2. ❌ **Build Complexity**: Needs 267 SPD + 250 ACC + 100% C.RATE + 35k+ HP
   - Requires strong Speed/Accuracy/Immortal gear
   - May need to regear other champions to compensate

3. ❌ **Lower Poison Volume than Frozen Banshee**:
   - Narma places 3 Poisons per 4 turns
   - FB places 2 Poisons per turn (8 Poisons per 4 turns)
   - Solo Narma has lower sustained Poison damage

4. ❌ **Instant Activation Requires Setup**:
   - Needs 3+ debuffs on CB BEFORE A3 cast
   - Turn order matters (Rhazin/Hotatsu before Narma)
   - If out of sync, loses 50% MAX HP burst damage

5. ❌ **Magic Affinity Weakness**:
   - Weak against Force CB (takes +15% damage, 15% ACC penalty)
   - May need to bench vs Force CB (use Stag Knight instead)

### **VS CURRENT ROSTER:**

**Current Team (40-68M):**
- Brogni, Aniri, Stag Knight, Mithrala, Geomancer

**Narma Team 1 (70-85M):**
- Brogni, Aniri, Hotatsu, Narma, Ninja
- **Changes**: Stag Knight → Hotatsu (dual Inc DEF + Dec ATK), Mithrala → Narma (Dec ATK + Leech + Heal), Geo → Ninja (raw DPS)

**Narma Team 2 (90-120M):**
- Brogni, Hotatsu, Rhazin, Narma, Frozen Banshee
- **Changes**: Aniri → Frozen Banshee (revive safety net removed, MAXIMUM POISON DAMAGE)

**VERDICT: Narma enables +50M damage (40-68M → 90-120M) but requires:**
- 13 Legendary books (2-3 months)
- Full Speed/Accuracy build (267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE)
- Team synergy (Hotatsu + Rhazin + FB all built for 267 SPD 3:2 tune)
- 4-6 week implementation timeline

## 9. Implementation Timeline

### **PHASE 1: Book & Build Narma (Weeks 1-8)**

**Week 1-2: Farming Legendary Books**
- Farm UNM Clan Boss daily (current team for 40-68M = top chest rewards)
- Estimated: 1-2 books per month → 6-8 weeks for 13 books
- **Alternative**: Use saved books if available

**Week 3-4: Gear Farming (Speed + Accuracy)**
- Farm Dragon 25 for Speed sets (4pc): SPD boots, HP% chest, gloves
- Farm Fire Knight 25 for Accuracy sets (2pc): ACC banner
- Target stats: 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE, 35k+ HP

**Week 5-6: Masteries (150 Gems or Mino Farm)**
- Prioritize: Warmaster (Tier 6 Offense) + Master Hexer (Tier 3 Support)
- Gem cost: 800 gems (instant) OR 2-3 days Mino 15 farming

**Week 7-8: Blessings (Brimstone Farm)**
- Farm Cursed City for Brimstone blessing
- Target: Tier 6 Brimstone (+30% Poison damage)
- Estimated: 2-4 weeks RNG farm

### **PHASE 2: Build Support Champions (Weeks 9-12)**

**Hotatsu Build:**
- 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 3500+ DEF (DEF scaling heals)
- Speed + Accuracy OR Speed + Immortal
- Books: 12 Epic books (if not already booked)
- **Timeline: 2-3 weeks** (if Hotatsu already built, skip to Week 11)

**Frozen Banshee Build (if running Team 2):**
- 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE
- Speed + Accuracy (Narma Leech eliminates Lifesteal requirement)
- Books: 10 Epic books (critical for 100% Poison proc)
- Brimstone blessing (+30% Poison damage)
- **Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

**Rhazin Build (if already owned):**
- 267 SPD, 250 ACC, 100% C.RATE, 3000+ DEF
- Speed + Accuracy
- Books: 14 Legendary books (if not already booked - EXPENSIVE)
- **Timeline: 4-6 weeks if unbooked** (or use partially booked for A2 priority)

### **PHASE 3: Speed Tune & Test (Weeks 13-16)**

**Week 13: Speed Tune Validation**
- Use Deadwood Jedi calculator (https://www.deadwoodjedi.com/speed-tunes-4/Slow-Skullcrusher)
- Target: All champions 267-277 SPD (3:2 ratio)
- Test in CB Normal/Hard for turn order verification

**Week 14-15: Turn Order Optimization**
- Ideal turn order for instant activation:
  1. Rhazin (Dec DEF + Weaken first)
  2. Hotatsu (Inc DEF + Dec ATK)
  3. Narma (A2 Dec ATK + Leech, or A3 Poison + instant activation)
  4. Frozen Banshee (Poison spam)
  5. Brogni (shields, Ally Protection)
- Adjust SPD by 1-2 points per champion to dial in order

**Week 16: UNM Testing & Damage Validation**
- Run 5 UNM tests with full team
- Target: 90-120M damage (conservative estimate)
- Document: Instant activation procs, Poison Sensitivity uptime, survivability

### **TOTAL TIMELINE: 12-16 WEEKS (3-4 Months)**

**IF SHORTCUTS AVAILABLE:**
- Saved Legendary books: -6 weeks
- Hotatsu already built: -2 weeks
- Rhazin already built: -4 weeks
- Frozen Banshee already built: -2 weeks
- **BEST CASE: 4-6 weeks** (if all champions owned + most books saved)

## Final Verdict: Should You Build Narma for UNM?

### **YES - Build Narma if:**
1. ✅ You have 13 Legendary books saved OR can farm for 2-3 months
2. ✅ You own Hotatsu + Frozen Banshee (both synergize perfectly)
3. ✅ You own Rhazin (Weaken + Dec DEF enable instant activation)
4. ✅ You want 90-120M UNM damage (50M+ increase from current 40-68M)
5. ✅ You're willing to farm Speed + Accuracy gear for 267 SPD + 250 ACC
6. ✅ You need a champion who works in CB, DT Hard, Hydra, and Faction Wars (high ROI)

### **MAYBE - Consider Alternatives if:**
1. ⚠️ You don't have Frozen Banshee built (Narma solo Poison is only 70-85M)
2. ⚠️ You don't have Rhazin (instant activation less reliable without Weaken)
3. ⚠️ You're short on Legendary books (<10 saved, can't farm for months)
4. ⚠️ Your current team already hits 70M+ (diminishing returns)

### **NO - Skip Narma if:**
1. ❌ You don't have Hotatsu, Frozen Banshee, OR Rhazin (Narma needs synergy team)
2. ❌ You can't hit 267 SPD + 250 ACC (gear quality too low)
3. ❌ You have Leonardo + Pain Keeper for unkillable team (higher damage ceiling 120M+)
4. ❌ You're F2P and books are ultra-scarce (prioritize other Legendaries)

---

## TLDR: Is Narma Top-Tier for UNM?

**YES - Narma is NOW top-tier post-buff (9/10 CB rating).**

**Why:**
- Simultaneous Poison + Poison Sensitivity (unique)
- Instant Poison activation (50% boss MAX HP burst)
- AOE Dec ATK + Leech + Heal (consolidates 3 roles)
- Debuff extension (maintains Poison Sensitivity 3+ turns)
- 96-145M damage contribution (with Brimstone blessing)

**Best Team:**
- Brogni, Hotatsu, Rhazin, Narma, Frozen Banshee
- Projected: 90-120M damage (conservative)
- Timeline: 12-16 weeks (3-4 months)

**ROI: Worth the investment if you have the synergy roster (Hotatsu + Rhazin + FB).**

If missing key champions, stick with current team and work toward Leonardo unkillable comp (120M+ long-term goal).
