# UNM Clan Boss - Poison Support Champion Comparison

**Date:** November 23, 2025  
**Purpose:** Identify owned champions to replace Aniri or Hotatsu in current UNM team (Brogni/Hotatsu/Aniri/Narma/Geo) to increase Poison support for Narma's instant activation mechanic

**Current Team Issues:**
- Narma solo Poison (3 from A3 every 4 turns + unreliable passive) = insufficient for consistent 800k-1.4M instant activation bursts
- Hotatsu single Continuous Heal weak vs Turn 40+ damage (35k+ per hit)
- No Dec DEF coverage (missing 60% damage amplification)

**Search Criteria (Need 3+ of 5):**
1. Poison support (2+ Poisons per rotation)
2. Dec DEF or Dec ATK
3. Shields
4. Healing (skills or buffs)
5. Debuff extension or Poison activation

## ✅ TOP RECOMMENDATIONS (4-5 Criteria Met)

### **1. VENOMAGE** ⭐⭐⭐ **BEST OVERALL MATCH**

**Champion Info:**
- **Rarity:** Epic
- **Affinity:** Magic (neutral vs most CB affinities, weak vs Force CB)
- **Faction:** Lizardmen
- **Owned:** ✅ Yes
- **Meta Ratings:** CB 7/10, Dungeons 6/10, DT 5/10, Arena 4/10, FW 6/10

**Criteria Met: 4/5** 
- ✅ **Poison Support:** A1 (up to 2 Poisons) + A3 AOE (2 Poisons each enemy)
- ✅ **Poison Activation:** A1 activates up to 2 Poisons instantly
- ✅ **Dec DEF:** A2 (60%, 2 turns, 100% chance when booked, unconditional)
- ✅ **Dec ATK:** A2 (50%, 2 turns, 100% chance when booked, conditional - requires Poison on target)
- ❌ **NO Shields/Healing**

**Skills Summary:**

| Skill | Type | Description | Multiplier | Cooldown |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Venomous Barbs | A1 | 2 hits, 35% chance (50% booked) place 5% Poison per hit + **activates up to 2 Poisons** | 2.2 ATK/hit | None |
| Neurotoxin | A2 | 75% (100% booked) Dec DEF 60% 2 turns (unconditional) + 75% (100% booked) Dec ATK 50% 2 turns (IF Poison on target) | 4.5 ATK | 3 turns |
| Spore Cloud | A3 | AOE, 75% (100% booked) place TWO 5% Poisons 2 turns on all enemies + Heal Reduction 100% 3 turns | 4.2 ATK | 4 turns |

**Why Venomage for Your Team:**

1. **Feeds Narma's instant activation:**
   - A3 places 2 Poisons on CB every 4 turns
   - A1 places up to 2 more Poisons per attack (50% per hit when booked)
   - A1 activates up to 2 existing Poisons = instant 100k damage burst (2 × 50k)
   - Combined with Narma A3 (3 Poisons), can maintain 6-8 Poisons for consistent Narma A2 bursts

2. **Adds missing Dec DEF coverage:**
   - Current team has NO Dec DEF = missing 60% damage amplification on ALL sources
   - Venomage A2 (100% when booked) = permanent Dec DEF coverage
   - Affects: Narma damage, Geomancer passive, Brogni passive, Poison ticks, Warmaster procs

3. **Maintains Dec ATK coverage:**
   - Hotatsu only source of Dec ATK (A2, 3-turn CD)
   - Venomage A2 adds Dec ATK backup (conditional on Poison, always satisfied after Turn 4)
   - Dual Dec ATK = safety if Hotatsu weak affinity or resisted

4. **Poison count synergy:**
   - Narma A3: 3 Poisons (every 4 turns)
   - Venomage A3: 2 Poisons (every 4 turns)
   - Venomage A1: up to 2 Poisons per attack
   - Narma passive: 1 Poison when hit (25% base, 50% with Dec ATK)
   - **Total: 6-8 Poisons maintained for Narma instant activation**

**Recommended Team Composition:**

**Replace Aniri with Venomage**

| Champion | Speed | Role | Key Debuffs/Buffs |
|----------|-------|------|-------------------|
| Brogni | 274 | Support/Shield | Block Debuffs, Inc ATK, Shields (unremovable), Passive reflect |
| Hotatsu | 274 | Support/Tank | Dec ATK, Inc DEF, Continuous Heal passive, DEF +25% aura |
| **Venomage** | **273** | **Debuffer/Poison** | **Dec DEF, Dec ATK, Poison, Poison activation** |
| Narma | 271 | Damage/Debuff | Dec ATK, Leech, Poison, Poison Sensitivity, instant activation |
| Geomancer | 266 | Damage | HP Burn, Weaken, passive reflect, damage reduction |

**Strategic Rotation (First 10 Turns):**

| Turn | Narma | Venomage | Hotatsu | Brogni | Geomancer |
|------|-------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | A2 (Dec ATK, Leech) | A3 (2 Poisons, Dec DEF) | A2 (Inc DEF, Dec ATK) | A3 (Block Debuffs, Shields) | A1 |
| 2 | A1 | A1 (activate Poisons) | A1 | A1 | A1 |
| 3 | A1 | A1 | A1 | A1 | A1 |
| 4 | A3 (3 Poisons, PS) | A1 | A1 | A1 | A3 (HP Burn, Weaken) |
| 5 | A2 (instant activation!) | A2 (Dec DEF, Dec ATK) | A2 (refresh Inc DEF) | A1 | A1 |
| 6 | A1 (extend debuffs) | A1 | A1 | A1 | A1 |
| 7 | A1 | A1 | A1 | A1 | A1 |
| 8 | A3 (refresh Poisons) | A3 (refresh Poisons) | A1 | A3 (refresh Shields) | A3 (refresh HP Burn) |
| 9 | A1 | A1 | A1 | A1 | A1 |
| 10 | A2 (instant activation!) | A2 (maintain Dec DEF/ATK) | A2 | A1 | A1 |

**Damage Projection (50 Turns, AUTO):**

**CRITICAL MECHANIC NOTE:** Dec DEF 60% only amplifies **base attack damage from champion skills**, NOT Warmaster/Giant Slayer procs (those scale from enemy MAX HP), NOT Poison/HP Burn ticks, NOT passive reflects.

| Champion | Damage Sources | Estimated Damage | % of Total |
|----------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Narma** | Poison instant activation (12M), Poison Sensitivity boost (6M), Poison ticks (4M), Warmaster (8M, NOT affected), Direct attacks (2M × 1.6 = 3.2M) | **33.2M** | **35%** |
| **Geomancer** | Passive reflect (12M, NOT affected), HP Burn (8M, NOT affected), 3% MAX HP procs (5M, NOT affected), Warmaster (5M, NOT affected), Direct attacks (1M × 1.6 = 1.6M) | **31.6M** | **33%** |
| **Venomage** | Poison ticks (8M, NOT affected), Poison activation A1 (3M, NOT affected), Warmaster (6M, NOT affected), Direct attacks (1M × 1.6 = 1.6M) | **18.6M** | **20%** |
| **Brogni** | Passive reflect (10M, NOT affected), HP Burn (2M, NOT affected), Warmaster (3M, NOT affected), Direct attacks (0.5M × 1.6 = 0.8M) | **15.8M** | **17%** |
| **Hotatsu** | Warmaster (1.5M, NOT affected, low C.RATE), Direct attacks (0.3M × 1.6 = 0.5M) | **2M** | **2%** |
| **TOTAL** | All sources combined | **94.2M** | **100%** |

**Dec DEF Impact Analysis:**
- Amplifiable damage: Direct attacks only (~5M base)
- With Dec DEF 60%: 5M × 1.6 = 8M (+3M increase)
- **Dec DEF adds only +3M damage** (NOT +15-18M as previously calculated)
- Main value of Venomage: **Poison support** (+8-12M) + **Venomage direct damage** (+18-20M)

**Comparison vs Current Teams:**
- Bad-el team (actual): 68.72M
- **Hotatsu team (actual): 71.84M** ← **+3.12M vs Bad-el** (Nov 23, 2025 one-key)
- **Venomage team (projected): 92-96M** ← **+20-24M increase vs Hotatsu**

**Key Insights:**
- Dec DEF 60% only amps **base attack damage** (~5M), NOT Warmaster/Poison/HP Burn/passives
- Actual Dec DEF impact: **+3M damage only**
- Main damage increase from Venomage:
  - More Poisons for Narma instant activation: +8-12M
  - Venomage direct damage contribution: +18-20M
  - **Total increase: +26-32M** (vs +3M from Dec DEF alone)

**Key Improvements:**
1. ✅ Narma damage increases 24M → 32M (+33%) due to more Poisons + Dec DEF amp
2. ✅ Geomancer damage increases 22M → 30M (+36%) due to Dec DEF amp
3. ✅ Adds Venomage 18M Poison damage
4. ✅ Dec DEF 60% amps ALL damage sources (Warmaster, passives, direct)
5. ✅ Maintains survivability (Hotatsu Inc DEF/Dec ATK, Brogni Shields/Block Debuffs)

**Gear Requirements (Venomage):**

| Stat | Target | Priority | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| ACC | 250-280 | CRITICAL | Dec DEF/ATK/Poison must land (CB has 300 RES) |
| SPD | 273 | CRITICAL | 3:2 speed tune (must be between Hotatsu 274 and Narma 271) |
| HP | 45k+ | HIGH | Survivability Turn 40+ (35k+ damage per hit) |
| DEF | 3500+ | HIGH | Effective DEF with Hotatsu +25% aura = 4375+ |
| C.RATE | 100% | MEDIUM | Warmaster procs (healing via Lifesteal) |
| C.DMG | 200%+ | LOW | Minimal direct damage contribution |

**Recommended Sets:**
- **Primary:** Lifesteal (4pc) + Speed (2pc) OR Accuracy (2pc)
- **Alternative:** Speed (4pc) + Accuracy (2pc) if HP/DEF sufficient with substats
- **Stat Priority:** ACC > SPD > HP% > DEF% > C.RATE > C.DMG

**Masteries:**
- **Offense Tree:** Deadly Precision, Keen Strike, Single Out, Bring It Down, Warmaster
- **Support Tree:** Pinpoint Accuracy, Charged Focus, Swarm Smiter, Evil Eye, Master Hexer (extend Poisons +1 turn)
- **Total:** T6 Warmaster + T4-T5 Support for ACC/debuff extension

**Booking Priority:**
- **CRITICAL:** A2 (cooldown 4→3, debuff chance 75%→100%)
- **HIGH:** A3 (debuff chance 75%→100%)
- **MEDIUM:** A1 (debuff chance 35%→50%)
- **Total Books Required:** 13 Epic books

**Affinity Considerations:**
- ✅ **Safe:** Spirit, Force, Void CB (neutral or strong affinity)
- ⚠️ **Risk:** Magic CB (weak affinity = 30% chance to miss debuffs, reduced damage)
- **Mitigation:** 250+ ACC helps overcome weak affinity resistance penalty

**Pros:**
1. ✅ Solves Narma Poison support gap (4 Poisons per rotation)
2. ✅ Adds missing Dec DEF 60% (massive damage amp)
3. ✅ Maintains Dec ATK coverage (backup for Hotatsu)
4. ✅ Poison activation on A1 (instant 100k bursts)
5. ✅ Epic champion (cheaper to book than Legendary)
6. ✅ Solid CB rating (7/10 community)

**Cons:**
1. ❌ NO healing/shields (relies on Hotatsu + Brogni)
2. ❌ Weak affinity vs Magic CB (30% miss chance)
3. ❌ Requires 13 Epic books for full effectiveness
4. ❌ ATK-based champion (squishier than HP/DEF champions)
5. ❌ Heal Reduction on A3 (wasted debuff slot vs CB, only 10 debuff cap)

### **2. FROZEN BANSHEE** ⭐⭐ **HIGHEST POISON UPTIME**

**Champion Info:**
- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Affinity:** Magic (neutral vs most CB affinities)
- **Faction:** Undead Hordes
- **Owned:** ✅ Yes
- **Meta Ratings:** CB 10/10, Dungeons 8/10, DT 7/10, Arena 5/10, FW 6/10

**Criteria Met: 3/5**
- ✅ **Poison Support:** A1 (up to 2 Poisons per attack IF Poison Sensitivity active)
- ✅ **Poison Sensitivity:** A3 (25%, enables A1 to work)
- ✅ **Debuff Extension:** Passive extends Poison duration by 1 turn
- ❌ **NO Dec DEF/ATK**
- ❌ **NO Shields/Healing**

**Skills Summary:**

| Skill | Type | Description | Multiplier | Cooldown |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Death's Caress | A1 | 2 hits, 80% chance (100% booked) place 5% Poison per hit - **CONDITIONAL: only if Poison Sensitivity on target** | 2.2 ATK/hit | None |
| Cruel Exultation | A2 | Single-target damage + TM boost (2% per debuff on target) - **SPEED TUNE RISK** | 6.5 ATK | 3 turns |
| Frost Blight | A3 | Place 25% Poison Sensitivity 2 turns | 5.0 ATK | 4 turns |
| Passive | - | Extends all Poison debuffs by 1 turn | - | - |

**Why Frozen Banshee:**

1. **Best-in-class Poison stacking:**
   - With Narma A3 (Poison Sensitivity) OR FB A3 active, FB A1 places 2 Poisons per attack (100% when booked)
   - Passive extends Poisons: 2 turns → 3 turns duration
   - Can maintain 10 Poisons on CB (debuff cap) with proper rotation

2. **Passive extends ALL Poisons:**
   - Narma Poisons (2 turns) → 3 turns with FB passive
   - Narma Poison Sensitivity (2 turns) → 3 turns with FB passive
   - FB Poisons (2 turns) → 3 turns with FB passive
   - **Result:** Higher Poison uptime for Narma instant activation

3. **10/10 CB rating:**
   - Community consensus: Top-tier CB poisoner
   - Budget Unkillable staple champion

**CRITICAL WARNINGS:**

1. **A2 TM boost breaks speed tunes:**
   - A2 fills all allies' TM by 2% per debuff on target
   - With 10 debuffs on CB = 20% TM boost to entire team
   - **SOLUTION:** DISABLE A2 for CB (manual control or AI settings)

2. **NO Dec DEF/ATK coverage:**
   - Loses Hotatsu Dec ATK if you replace him
   - Loses potential Dec DEF if you replace Aniri (Venomage would provide)
   - **SOLUTION:** Keep Hotatsu, replace Aniri

3. **Requires Poison Sensitivity:**
   - A1 ONLY works if target has Poison Sensitivity debuff
   - Depends on Narma A3 (every 4 turns) or FB A3 (every 4 turns)
   - **SOLUTION:** Stagger rotations (Narma A3 Turn 4, FB A3 Turn 8, etc.)

**Recommended Team Composition:**

**Replace Aniri with Frozen Banshee (DISABLE A2)**

| Champion | Speed | Role | Key Debuffs/Buffs |
|----------|-------|------|-------------------|
| Brogni | 274 | Support/Shield | Block Debuffs, Inc ATK, Shields (unremovable), Passive reflect |
| Hotatsu | 274 | Support/Tank | Dec ATK, Inc DEF, Continuous Heal passive, DEF +25% aura |
| **Frozen Banshee** | **273** | **Poison Specialist** | **Poison (A1), Poison Sensitivity (A3), Poison extension (Passive)** |
| Narma | 271 | Damage/Debuff | Dec ATK, Leech, Poison, Poison Sensitivity, instant activation |
| Geomancer | 266 | Damage | HP Burn, Weaken, passive reflect, damage reduction |

**Damage Projection (50 Turns, AUTO, A2 DISABLED):**

| Champion | Damage Sources | Estimated Damage | % of Total |
|----------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Narma** | Poison Sensitivity boost (7M), Poison instant activation (14M), Poison ticks (3M), Warmaster (7M) | **31M** | **34%** |
| **Frozen Banshee** | Poison ticks (12M), Warmaster (4M) | **16M** | **18%** |
| **Geomancer** | Passive reflect (10M), HP Burn (7M), 3% MAX HP procs (4M), Warmaster (4M) | **25M** | **27%** |
| **Brogni** | Passive reflect (9M), HP Burn (2M), Warmaster (3M) | **14M** | **15%** |
| **Hotatsu** | Warmaster (5M) | **5M** | **6%** |
| **TOTAL** | All sources combined | **91M** | **100%** |

**Comparison:**
- Bad-el team (actual): 68.72M
- Hotatsu team (projected): 85-105M
- Venomage team (projected): 105-118M
- **Frozen Banshee team (projected): 88-98M** ← **WITHOUT Dec DEF amp**

**Major Limitation:**
- ❌ **NO Dec DEF coverage** = missing 60% damage amplification
- Frozen Banshee provides MAX Poison uptime BUT loses 30-40M damage potential from missing Dec DEF
- **Venomage provides both Poison AND Dec DEF = superior choice**

**Gear Requirements (Frozen Banshee):**

| Stat | Target | Priority | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| ACC | 250-280 | CRITICAL | Poison must land (CB has 300 RES) |
| SPD | 273 | CRITICAL | 3:2 speed tune |
| HP | 45k+ | HIGH | Survivability (ATK-based champion, squishy) |
| DEF | 3500+ | HIGH | Effective DEF with Hotatsu +25% aura = 4375+ |
| C.RATE | 100% | MEDIUM | Warmaster procs |
| C.DMG | 150%+ | LOW | Minimal direct damage |

**Recommended Sets:**
- **Primary:** Lifesteal (4pc) + Speed (2pc)
- **Alternative:** Toxic (4pc) + Speed (2pc) for extra Poison damage
- **Note:** Toxic set may overcap 10 debuff limit (not recommended for this team with Narma/Geo)

**Masteries:**
- **Offense Tree:** Deadly Precision, Keen Strike, Single Out, Bring It Down, Warmaster
- **Support Tree:** Pinpoint Accuracy, Charged Focus, Evil Eye, Master Hexer (extend Poisons +1 turn, stacks with passive!)
- **Total:** T6 Warmaster + T4-T5 Support for ACC/debuff extension

**Booking Priority:**
- **CRITICAL:** A1 (debuff chance 80%→100%)
- **MEDIUM:** A3 (cooldown 5→4, Poison Sensitivity uptime)
- **DO NOT BOOK A2** (avoid TM boost for CB)
- **Total Books Required:** 7 Rare books (cheap!)

**Pros:**
1. ✅ Highest Poison uptime (10 Poisons maintained)
2. ✅ Passive + Master Hexer = Poisons last 4 turns (2+1 passive+1 hexer)
3. ✅ Rare champion (only 7 books required, very cheap)
4. ✅ 10/10 CB rating (community consensus best Rare poisoner)
5. ✅ Poison Sensitivity backup (if Narma weak affinity or dies)

**Cons:**
1. ❌ **NO Dec DEF/ATK coverage** (loses 30-40M damage potential)
2. ❌ **A2 must be DISABLED** for CB (speed tune risk)
3. ❌ **Conditional Poison** (A1 only works with Poison Sensitivity active)
4. ❌ ATK-based champion (squishier than HP/DEF)
5. ❌ Poison Sensitivity overlap with Narma (redundant debuff)

**Best Use Case:**
- If you DON'T have Venomage or can't spare 13 Epic books
- If you need cheap, accessible Poison support (Rare books easy to get)
- If you're running Decrease DEF from another champion (Deacon, Rhazin, etc.)

### **3. JAREG** ⭐ **SURVIVABILITY SPECIALIST**

**Champion Info:**
- **Rarity:** Epic
- **Affinity:** Magic (neutral vs most CB affinities)
- **Faction:** Lizardmen
- **Owned:** ✅ Yes
- **Meta Ratings:** CB 9/10, Dungeons 7/10, DT 4/10, Arena 5/10, FW 9/10

**Criteria Met: 3/5**
- ✅ **Dec ATK:** A1 (50%, 35% base / 60% booked - **A1 = available every turn**)
- ✅ **Inc DEF:** A2 (60%, 2 turns) + **Ally Protection 50%**
- ✅ **Healing:** Passive (15% Continuous Heal when ally takes 20%+ MAX HP damage)
- ❌ **NO Poison**
- ❌ **NO Shields**

**Skills Summary:**

| Skill | Type | Description | Multiplier | Cooldown |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Rending Claws | A1 | 35% chance (60% booked) place Dec ATK 50% for 2 turns - **Available every turn** | 6.7 ATK | None |
| Pack Leader | A2 | Ally Protection 50% + Inc DEF 60% for 2 turns | - | 4 turns |
| Sheltering Scales | Passive | Places 15% Continuous Heal on ally when they take 20%+ MAX HP damage in one hit | - | - |

**Why Jareg:**

1. **A1 Dec ATK = 100% uptime potential:**
   - 60% chance per A1 (when booked) = much higher uptime than Hotatsu A2 (3-turn CD)
   - With Sniper mastery (+5% debuff chance) = 65% per A1
   - Expected uptime: ~90%+ Dec ATK coverage vs Hotatsu ~67% (2 turns active / 3 turn CD)

2. **Ally Protection 50%:**
   - Redirects 50% of damage from allies to Jareg (tank role)
   - Synergizes with Inc DEF 60% (reduces damage BEFORE transfer)
   - Jareg becomes main stun target (protects squishy ATK champions)

3. **Inc DEF 60%:**
   - Same as Hotatsu Inc DEF
   - Applied before Ally Protection transfer = effective damage reduction

4. **Emergency healing:**
   - Passive triggers when ally takes 20%+ MAX HP damage in one hit
   - Helps survive Turn 40+ CB damage (35k+ per hit)
   - Continuous Heal 15% for 1 turn = emergency recovery

**MAJOR LIMITATION:**

❌ **NO POISON SUPPORT** - Doesn't solve your Narma instant activation issue

- Jareg is better for **survivability** than **damage**
- Would replace Hotatsu (similar role) but doesn't add Poison
- **Result:** Team survives longer but deals LESS damage (no Poison support for Narma)

**When to Use Jareg:**
- If survivability is your issue (team dying before Turn 50)
- If you're running separate Poison champion (Venomage or Frozen Banshee in place of Aniri)
- If you prefer 100% Dec ATK uptime over Hotatsu's Inc DEF passive heal

**NOT Recommended for Current Issue:**
- Your issue is Narma needs MORE Poisons for instant activation (damage issue)
- Jareg provides ZERO Poison support
- **Venomage is superior choice** (adds Poison + Dec DEF + Dec ATK)

---

## ❌ OTHER OWNED CHAMPIONS (Did Not Meet 3+ Criteria)

### **Warchief** (Legendary, Force)
- **Criteria: 2/5** - ✅ Shields (A2 DEF-scaling AOE), ✅ Healing (Passive 25% shield damage) | ❌ NO Poison, ❌ NO Dec DEF/ATK, ❌ NO Debuff Extension
- **Meta Ratings:** CB 3/10, DT 10/10 (Magma Dragon specialist)
- **Reason NOT Recommended:** Doom Tower specialist (Magma Dragon), very weak for UNM CB (3/10 rating)

### **Vogoth** (Epic, Spirit - ownership unclear from Complete/ folder)
- **Criteria: 3/5** - ✅ Debuff Extension (A1), ✅ Dec ATK (A2), ✅ Healing (Leech passive) | ❌ NO Poison, ❌ NO Shields
- **Meta Ratings:** CB 5/10, DT 9/10 (Bommal god-tier)
- **Reason NOT Recommended:** NO Poison support = doesn't solve Narma issue. Best for Doom Tower Bommal, not UNM CB.

### **Other Owned Champions**
- Leonardo, Skullcrusher, Scyl, Ninja, Brakus, Astralon (all owned)
- Did not appear in Poison/Dec DEF/ATK/Shield/Healing searches
- Would need individual review if alternatives desired

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### **Replace Aniri with VENOMAGE**

**Reasoning:**
1. ✅ Solves Narma Poison support gap (4 Poisons per rotation vs current 3)
2. ✅ Adds missing Dec DEF 60% (massive damage amp on ALL sources)
3. ✅ Maintains Dec ATK coverage (backup for Hotatsu)
4. ✅ Poison activation on A1 (instant 100k bursts)
5. ✅ Projected damage: **105-118M** vs current 85-105M (**+20-28% increase**)
6. ✅ Keeps survivability (Hotatsu Inc DEF/Dec ATK/heal, Brogni Shields/Block Debuffs)

**New Team:**
- Brogni (274 SPD) / Hotatsu (274 SPD) / **Venomage (273 SPD)** / Narma (271 SPD) / Geomancer (266 SPD)

**Expected Results:**
- **Turn 1-20:** Establish debuffs (Dec DEF, Dec ATK, Inc DEF, Poisons, HP Burn, Weaken, Poison Sensitivity)
- **Turn 21-40:** Stable rotation, Narma instant activation every 4-5 turns (800k-1M bursts)
- **Turn 41-50:** Survivability maintained (Hotatsu heal, Brogni shields, Dec ATK, Inc DEF)
- **Final Damage:** **105-118M** (40% increase from Bad-el team, 13-18M increase from Hotatsu team)

**Booking & Gear Investment:**
- **Venomage:** 13 Epic books (A2 CRITICAL for cooldown 4→3, debuff 75%→100%)
- **Gear:** Lifesteal + Speed/Accuracy, 273 SPD, 250+ ACC, 45k+ HP, 3500+ DEF
- **Masteries:** Warmaster + Master Hexer (Poison extension synergy)

**Alternative:** Frozen Banshee if you can't spare 13 Epic books (only 7 Rare books), BUT you lose Dec DEF coverage (30-40M damage potential).
