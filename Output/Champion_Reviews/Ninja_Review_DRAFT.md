## 1. Champion Overview

**Name:** Ninja  
**Rarity:** Legendary  
**Affinity:** Magic  
**Faction:** Shadowkin  
**Role:** Attack (HP Burn specialist, Freeze control, Boss killer)

### Primary Use Cases

**Clan Boss UNM (Priority 1):**
- **Best-in-class HP Burn activation:** A2 (Hailburn) places 3-turn HP Burn on 3 random targets, then **instantly activates all HP Burns on Boss** (including HP Burns from other champions)
- **Passive damage scaling:** Escalation passive stacks ATK by 20% and C.DMG by 10% per skill cycle on Boss (max 100% ATK + 25% C.DMG = 125% total stat boost)
- **Decrease DEF on A1:** 60% Decrease DEF (2 turns) enables higher team damage
- **Perfect for Unkillable teams:** Pairs exceptionally well with Pain Keeper, Maneater, Warcaster unkillable comps

**Dungeons (Priority 2):**
- **Dragon 25:** HP Burn + Freeze for wave control, high boss damage with A2 activation
- **Fire Knight 25:** Multi-hit A2 (3 hits) helps break shield, HP Burn for boss damage
- **Ice Golem 25:** AOE Freeze on waves, HP Burn on boss (Magic affinity = strong vs Spirit boss)
- **Spider 25:** Moderate - HP Burn is single-target (A2 random hits), AOE Freeze requires manual play vs spiderlings

**Doom Tower Hard (Priority 3):**
- **Bommal (Dreadbombs):** AOE Freeze reduces Dreadbomb explosion damage by 50% (Frozen debuff effect)
- **Frost Spider:** HP Burn activation + Freeze for spiderling control
- **Celestial Griffin:** HP Burn activation for high damage

**Arena (Priority 4):**
- **Classic Arena (Gold 3+):** AOE Freeze control (100% chance booked), decent nuker with passive stacks
- **Tag Team Arena:** Freeze control + HP Burn for sustain damage
- **Live Arena:** Freeze control, but vulnerable to high-resist teams

**Faction Wars (Priority 5):**
- **Shadowkin Faction:** Excellent for Shadowkin Faction Wars (HP Burn + Freeze + Decrease DEF)

### Champion Summary

Ninja is a **Legendary Attack Magic** champion from the Shadowkin faction, specializing in **HP Burn activation** and **AOE Freeze control**. His signature skill, **Hailburn (A2)**, is unique in RAID: it places 3-turn HP Burn debuffs on 3 random targets, then **instantly activates all HP Burns on Bosses** (including HP Burns from allies), dealing massive MAX HP-based damage that ignores 100% Defense. His **Cyan Slash (A3)** provides 100% AOE Freeze (booked) for wave control, or when used on Bosses, ignores 50% DEF and reduces A2 cooldown by 1 turn. His **Escalation passive** stacks ATK and C.DMG per skill cycle, reaching up to **100% ATK + 25% C.DMG** against Bosses, making him a **scaling damage dealer** who grows stronger as fights progress.

Ninja excels in **Clan Boss UNM** (unkillable teams, HP Burn activation), **Dungeons** (HP Burn + Freeze), and **Doom Tower Hard bosses** (Bommal, Frost Spider, Celestial Griffin). He is **tied for 2nd-best HP Burn champion** among owned roster (with Geomancer at 9/10, behind Artak at 10/10), and is the **ONLY owned champion with 2-turn AOE Freeze** (Scyl has 1-turn Stun, Loki has 2-turn Sleep, but Freeze is superior for Dreadbomb mitigation).

## 2. Content-Specific Ratings (X/10 Contextualized)

**Rating Context:** All ratings compare Ninja to **OWNED champions only** (validated against `input/Owned_champion_list.md`). Ratings reflect Ninja's performance relative to your roster, not the entire RAID champion pool.

### Clan Boss UNM: **9/10** (Tied for 2nd-Best HP Burn Champion)

**Why 9/10:**
- **HP Burn activation is UNIQUE:** Ninja is the ONLY owned champion who can **instantly activate HP Burns on Bosses** (Hailburn A2). This mechanic deals massive damage (7.5% Enemy MAX HP per activation, ignores 100% DEF).
- **Tied with Geomancer (9/10) for 2nd-best HP Burn:** Both Ninja and Geomancer excel at HP Burn, but Artak (10/10) edges ahead due to A2 HP Burn (guaranteed placement vs Ninja's 3 random hits) and better uptime.
- **Passive scaling (100% ATK + 25% C.DMG):** After 5 skill cycles on Boss, Ninja reaches max stacks, dramatically increasing his damage output for the remainder of the fight.
- **Perfect for Unkillable teams:** Pairs with Pain Keeper (x3 owned), Maneater, Warcaster for safe, high-damage UNM runs.

**Validated HP Burn Champion Comparison (Owned Only):**

| Champion | HP Burn Rating | HP Burn Skill | Uptime | Activation on Boss? | Notes |
|----------|----------------|---------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **Artak** | **10/10** | A2 (single-target, 100% chance booked, 3-turn duration, 3-turn CD) | Excellent (near-permanent uptime) | No (but consistent placement) | BEST HP Burn champion - A2 skill, consistent placement, excellent uptime |
| **Ninja** | **9/10** | A2 (3 random targets, 100% chance booked, 3-turn duration, 3-turn CD) | Excellent (A3 reduces A2 CD by 1 turn) | **YES (instant activation)** | UNIQUE HP Burn activation mechanic - instantly activates all HP Burns on Boss |
| **Geomancer** | **9/10** | Passive (when hit by enemy, 100% chance, 2-turn duration) | Excellent (passive, no CD) | No | Tied with Ninja - passive HP Burn, excellent uptime, no CD required |
| **Akoth the Seared** | **7/10** | A3 (AOE, 75%→100% chance booked, 2-turn duration, 5→4-turn CD) | Good (4-turn CD) | No | AOE HP Burn, but longer CD and shorter duration than Artak/Ninja |
| **Drexthar Bloodtwin** | **7/10** | Passive (when attacked, 50% chance, 2-turn duration) | Good (passive, but 50% proc rate) | No | Passive HP Burn, but 50% proc rate makes uptime inconsistent |

**Why NOT 10/10:**
- Artak has more consistent HP Burn placement (A2 single-target vs Ninja's 3 random hits)
- Ninja's A2 can miss high-priority targets in multi-target scenarios (e.g., Spider Den)
- Requires books to reach 100% HP Burn chance (5 books on A2)

**PVE Disclaimer:** Ninja requires full booking (13 books total: A2 + A3) for optimal performance in Clan Boss UNM. Partial investment: Book A2 first (5 books) for 100% HP Burn chance, then A3 (6 books) for cooldown reduction.

---

### Dungeons: **9/10** (Excellent All-Rounder)

**Dragon 25: 9/10**
- HP Burn for boss damage (instant activation)
- AOE Freeze for wave control (100% chance booked)
- Magic affinity = strong vs Spirit Dragon (no weak hits)
- Decrease DEF (60%, 2 turns) boosts team damage

**Fire Knight 25: 8/10**
- Multi-hit A2 (3 hits) helps break shield
- HP Burn for boss damage
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost
- AOE Freeze for wave control
- **Note:** Magic affinity = weak vs Force Fire Knight (may miss debuffs)

**Ice Golem 25: 9/10**
- HP Burn for boss damage
- AOE Freeze for minion control (prevents counterattacks)
- Magic affinity = strong vs Spirit Ice Golem
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost

**Spider 25: 7/10**
- HP Burn is single-target (A2 random hits, not ideal for spiderlings)
- AOE Freeze requires manual play (AI prioritizes boss over spiderlings)
- Decent boss damage with A2 activation
- **Better options:** Artak (A2 single-target HP Burn + AOE A3), Geomancer (passive HP Burn on all attackers)

**Validated Freeze Champion Comparison (Owned Only):**

| Champion | Freeze/Control Rating | Control Skill | Duration | AOE? | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|----------|------|-------|
| **Ninja** | **10/10** | A3 (AOE Freeze, 100% chance booked, 1-turn duration initially, 2 turns when extended) | 1 turn (2 with extension) | YES | ONLY owned champion with AOE Freeze |
| **Scyl of the Drakes** | **8/10** | A2 (AOE Stun, 30% chance, 1-turn duration) | 1 turn | YES | Stun (not Freeze), lower proc chance (30% vs Ninja's 100%) |
| **Loki** | **9/10** | A3 (AOE Sleep, 100% chance, 2-turn duration) | 2 turns | YES | Sleep (not Freeze), breaks on damage, but 2-turn duration |
| **Akoth the Seared** | **6/10** | Passive (25% Fear when HP Burn activates, 1-turn duration) | 1 turn | Single-target | Fear (not Freeze), 25% proc chance, single-target only |

**Why Ninja is BEST for Freeze:**
- **ONLY owned champion with AOE Freeze:** Freeze debuff is superior to Stun/Sleep for specific bosses (e.g., Bommal Dreadbombs - Freeze reduces explosion damage by 50%)
- **100% proc chance (booked):** Reliable control vs Scyl's 30% Stun chance
- **Works on auto:** Unlike Loki's Sleep (breaks on damage), Freeze persists for full duration

**Why NOT 10/10 overall for Dungeons:**
- Spider 25 performance is moderate (7/10) due to single-target HP Burn and manual-required Freeze
- Fire Knight weak affinity (Magic vs Force) reduces reliability

---

### Doom Tower Hard: **9/10** (Excellent Boss Killer)

**Bommal the Dreadhorn: 10/10**
- **AOE Freeze reduces Dreadbomb explosion damage by 50%:** Critical mechanic for surviving Hard mode
- HP Burn activation for boss damage
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost
- **Best use case for Ninja's Freeze:** Dreadbombs are the primary threat, Freeze is superior to Stun/Sleep

**Frost Spider: 9/10**
- HP Burn activation for boss damage
- AOE Freeze for spiderling control
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost

**Celestial Griffin: 9/10**
- HP Burn activation for high damage (Griffin has high MAX HP)
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost
- AOE Freeze for wave control (Griffin summons adds)

**Dark Fae: 8/10**
- HP Burn activation for damage
- AOE Freeze for Dark Fae clone control
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost

**Eternal Dragon: 8/10**
- HP Burn activation for damage
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost
- **Note:** Dragon is immune to Freeze

**Why NOT 10/10 overall:**
- Some Doom Tower Hard bosses are immune to Freeze (Eternal Dragon, Scarab King)
- Requires high ACC (350+ for Hard mode) and survivability (50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF)

---

### Advanced PVE Content: **8/10**

**Cursed City (Amius): 8/10**
- HP Burn activation for damage
- AOE Freeze for minion control
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost

**Iron Twins Fortress: 7/10**
- HP Burn activation for damage
- AOE Freeze for minion control
- **Note:** Iron Twins have Damage Limit mechanic (limits HP Burn effectiveness)

**Chimera: 8/10**
- HP Burn activation for head damage
- AOE Freeze for head control (prevents head attacks)
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost

**Hydra Brutal: 8/10**
- HP Burn activation for head damage
- AOE Freeze for head control
- Decrease DEF for team damage boost
- **Note:** Randomness of A2 (3 random hits) makes targeting specific heads difficult

**Why NOT 10/10:**
- Iron Twins Damage Limit reduces HP Burn effectiveness
- Hydra randomness (A2 targets random heads, not optimal for focused head kills)

---

### Arena: **7/10** (Good Freeze Control, Moderate Nuker)

**Classic Arena (Gold 3+): 7/10**
- AOE Freeze control (100% chance booked, 1 turn)
- Decent nuker with passive stacks (up to 100% ATK after 10 skill cycles)
- Decrease DEF (60%, 2 turns) enables team nukes
- **Weakness:** User often loses speed battle in higher tiers, Ninja requires time to stack passive (not ideal for fast Arena clears)

**Tag Team Arena (Bronze 3+): 7/10**
- AOE Freeze control for safe team
- HP Burn for sustain damage
- **Note:** Lower priority than Classic Arena (user's stated preference)

**Live Arena: 6/10**
- AOE Freeze control
- Decent nuker
- **Weakness:** Vulnerable to high-resist teams, immunity sets, and cleansers (Arbiter, Godseeker Aniri, Rector Drath)

**Validated Speed Lead Comparison (Owned Only):**

Ninja does NOT have a Speed lead aura. For Arena, pair with:
- **Arbiter:** 30% SPD (Arena), 19% SPD (All Battles) - BEST owned Speed lead for Arena
- **High Khatun:** 19% SPD (Arena) - Good budget option
- **Seeker:** 24% SPD (Arena) - Solid mid-tier option

**Why NOT 8-10/10:**
- User often loses speed battle in higher Arena tiers (Ninja requires time to stack passive)
- Better Arena options: Wukong (speed lead + nuke + buff strip), Loki (control + buff strip + suppress)
- Ninja is more PVE-focused (Clan Boss, Dungeons, Doom Tower) than Arena-optimized

---

### Faction Wars: **9/10** (Excellent for Shadowkin)

**Shadowkin Faction Status:** 
- **User Progress:** Not listed in completed or near-completion factions (assumed in-progress or not started)
- **Ninja's Role:** HP Burn (damage), AOE Freeze (control), Decrease DEF (team support)

**Why 9/10:**
- HP Burn provides consistent damage against high-HP Faction Wars enemies
- AOE Freeze controls waves and prevents enemy attacks
- Decrease DEF (60%, 2 turns) boosts team damage
- Magic affinity = neutral vs most Faction Wars affinities (no weak hits except vs Force)

**Why NOT 10/10:**
- Shadowkin faction not prioritized by user (no mention in copilot-instructions.md priority list)
- User prioritizes completing: Lizardmen, Knights Revenant, High Elf, Dark Elf (near-completion factions)

## 3. Skills & Mechanics

**Skill Validation Sources:** Ayumilove + HellHades (2/2 sources validated)

---

### A1: Shatterbolt (Default Attack)

**Skill Description:**
- Attacks 1 enemy
- **45%→60% chance** (booked) to place a **60% Decrease DEF debuff** for **2 turns**
- **Fills this Champion's Turn Meter by 15%** when used against Bosses

**Damage Multiplier:** 3.7 ATK

**Skill Books Required:** 4 books
- Level 2: Damage +5%
- Level 3: Damage +5%
- Level 4: Buff/Debuff Chance +5% (50% total)
- Level 5: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (60% total, booked)

**Key Mechanics:**
1. **Decrease DEF (60%, 2 turns):** Strong debuff, enables higher team damage
2. **Turn Meter boost (15% vs Bosses):** Increases Ninja's turn frequency in Clan Boss fights, synergizes with Escalation passive (faster skill cycling = faster stacks)
3. **Single-target:** Not ideal for wave clear, but excellent for Clan Boss/Boss fights

**Use Cases:**
- **Clan Boss UNM:** Decrease DEF (60%) is critical for team damage, TM boost cycles skills faster
- **Dungeons:** Decrease DEF for boss damage boost
- **Arena:** Decrease DEF enables team nukes

**Investment Priority:** **MEDIUM** - Book to 60% Decrease DEF chance if books available, but prioritize A2 and A3 first.

---

### A2: Hailburn (Signature Skill)

**Cooldown:** 4 turns → 3 turns (booked)

**Skill Description:**
- Attacks **3 times at random**
- Each hit has a **75%→100% chance** (booked) of placing **HP Burn debuff for 3 turns**
- Places a **Perfect Veil buff** on this Champion for **2 turns**
- **When used against Bosses, will instantly activate any HP Burn debuffs** (including HP Burn debuffs placed by this Skill and by other champions)

**Damage Multiplier:** 2 ATK (per hit, 6 ATK total across 3 hits)

**Skill Books Required:** 5 books
- Level 2: Damage +5%
- Level 3: Damage +10%
- Level 4: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (85% total)
- Level 5: Buff/Debuff Chance +15% (100% total, booked)
- Level 6: Cooldown -1 (3-turn CD, booked)

**Key Mechanics:**

1. **HP Burn Activation on Bosses (UNIQUE):**
   - **This is Ninja's signature mechanic and what makes him S-tier for Clan Boss UNM**
   - When Hailburn is used against a Boss, it **instantly activates all HP Burn debuffs** on the Boss (including HP Burns from allies like Artak, Geomancer, Akoth, Drexthar)
   - Each HP Burn activation deals **7.5% Enemy MAX HP damage** (ignores 100% DEF)
   - Example: If Ninja places 3 HP Burns with A2, then activates them, that's **3 × 7.5% = 22.5% Enemy MAX HP damage** in a single turn (plus A2 base damage)
   - **Multi-champion synergy:** Pair Ninja with other HP Burn champions (Artak, Geomancer) to place multiple HP Burns, then activate all with Ninja's A2

2. **Perfect Veil (2 turns):**
   - Makes Ninja untargetable by single-target attacks (only AOE attacks can hit)
   - Useful for survivability in Clan Boss (avoids Stun targeting) and Arena (avoids single-target nukes)

3. **3 Random Hits:**
   - **Advantage (Fire Knight):** Multi-hit helps break Fire Knight's shield (3 hits = 3 shield break attempts)
   - **Disadvantage (Spider, Hydra):** Cannot target specific enemies (random hits spread across targets)

4. **3-Turn HP Burn Duration:**
   - Longest HP Burn duration among owned champions (Geomancer: 2 turns, Akoth: 2 turns, Drexthar: 2 turns)
   - Extended duration increases chance of HP Burn persisting after activation

**Use Cases:**
- **Clan Boss UNM:** PRIMARY damage source - HP Burn activation deals 22.5%+ Enemy MAX HP damage per use
- **Dungeons (Dragon, Ice Golem):** HP Burn activation for boss damage
- **Doom Tower Hard (Bommal, Frost Spider, Celestial Griffin):** HP Burn activation for high damage
- **Fire Knight:** Multi-hit (3 hits) helps break shield

**Investment Priority:** **CRITICAL** - Book A2 FIRST (5 books) to reach 100% HP Burn chance and 3-turn CD. This is Ninja's most important skill.

---

### A3: Cyan Slash (AOE Freeze / Boss Ignore DEF)

**Cooldown:** 5 turns → 4 turns (booked)

**Skill Description:**
- **Against all enemies:** Attacks all enemies, has a **75%→100% chance** (booked) of placing a **Freeze debuff for 1 turn**
- **Against a Boss (single-target):** Only attacks the Boss (not all enemies), ignores **50% of the target's DEF**, and **decreases the cooldown of the Hailburn skill by 1 turn**

**Damage Multiplier:** 
- 3 ATK (AOE vs all enemies)
- 3.95 ATK (single-target vs Boss)

**Skill Books Required:** 6 books
- Level 2: Damage +15%
- Level 3: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (85% total)
- Level 4: Buff/Debuff Chance +15% (100% total, booked)
- Level 5: Cooldown -1 (4-turn CD, booked)

**Key Mechanics:**

1. **AOE Freeze (100% chance booked, 1 turn):**
   - **ONLY owned champion with AOE Freeze debuff** (Scyl has AOE Stun 30%, Loki has AOE Sleep but breaks on damage)
   - **Freeze is superior to Stun/Sleep for Bommal Dreadbombs:** Frozen enemies deal 50% reduced damage when they attack (critical for Dreadbomb explosions)
   - 1-turn duration can be extended to 2 turns with debuff extension champions (e.g., Michelangelo A2)

2. **Boss Ignore DEF (50%) + A2 Cooldown Reduction:**
   - When used against a Boss, Cyan Slash switches to **single-target mode** (does NOT hit all enemies)
   - Ignores 50% DEF (deals higher damage to Boss)
   - **Reduces Hailburn (A2) cooldown by 1 turn:** Critical for Clan Boss - allows more frequent HP Burn activations
   - Example: A2 has 3-turn CD (booked), A3 reduces it by 1 turn, so A2 is available every 2 turns if A3 is used optimally

3. **Auto AI Behavior:**
   - On auto, Ninja will prioritize using A3 on Bosses (single-target Ignore DEF mode) over using A3 on waves (AOE Freeze mode)
   - **This is a DISADVANTAGE for Spider 25:** Ninja will not freeze spiderlings on auto, requiring manual play for wave control

**Use Cases:**
- **Clan Boss UNM:** A3 reduces A2 cooldown by 1 turn, increasing HP Burn activation frequency
- **Dungeons (Dragon, Ice Golem, Fire Knight):** AOE Freeze for wave control (manual play), Boss Ignore DEF for boss damage (auto play)
- **Doom Tower Hard (Bommal):** AOE Freeze reduces Dreadbomb explosion damage by 50% (CRITICAL mechanic)
- **Arena:** AOE Freeze control (100% chance booked, 1 turn)

**Investment Priority:** **HIGH** - Book A3 after A2 (6 books) to reach 100% Freeze chance and 4-turn CD. Cooldown reduction for A2 is critical for Clan Boss.

---

### Passive: Escalation (Stat Stacking)

**Skill Description:**
- Increases Ninja's **ATK by 10%** (up to 100%) and **C.DMG by 2.5%** (up to 25%) each time a single enemy is hit by all three of Ninja's Active Skills (A1, A2, A3) in a single Round
- This effect can occur **multiple times against the same enemy**
- **When fighting Bosses, will increase Ninja's ATK by 20%** (up to 100%) and **C.DMG by 10%** (up to 25%) instead

**Key Mechanics:**

1. **Stack Requirements:**
   - **Champions:** 1 stack = A1 + A2 + A3 used on same target in 1 round → +10% ATK, +2.5% C.DMG
   - **Bosses:** 1 stack = A1 + A2 + A3 used on Boss in 1 round → +20% ATK, +10% C.DMG
   - **Max stacks (Champions):** 10 stacks = 100% ATK, 25% C.DMG
   - **Max stacks (Bosses):** 5 stacks = 100% ATK, 25% C.DMG

2. **Stacking Speed:**
   - **Bosses:** Ninja reaches max stacks (100% ATK, 25% C.DMG) after 5 skill cycles (A1→A2→A3 × 5)
   - **Champions (Arena, waves):** Ninja reaches max stacks after 10 skill cycles (A1→A2→A3 × 10)
   - **Turn Meter boost (A1):** Ninja's A1 boosts his TM by 15% vs Bosses, accelerating skill cycling and stack accumulation

3. **Permanent Duration (per fight):**
   - Stacks persist for the entire fight (do not expire or reset)
   - Once Ninja reaches max stacks (100% ATK, 25% C.DMG), he remains at max power for the rest of the fight

4. **Build Implications:**
   - **Defensive builds viable:** Because Ninja gains +100% ATK and +25% C.DMG from passive, you can build him with more HP/DEF/ACC and less ATK, and he will still deal high damage once stacked
   - **Offensive builds for fast clear:** If building for Arena or fast dungeon clears, prioritize ATK/C.DMG from gear to maximize damage before stacks accumulate

**Use Cases:**
- **Clan Boss UNM:** Ninja reaches max stacks (100% ATK, 25% C.DMG) after ~5 turns, then maintains max damage for the entire fight (20-50 turns)
- **Dungeons (Dragon, Ice Golem, Fire Knight, Spider):** Ninja stacks quickly on Boss (5 cycles), deals high damage in mid-late fight
- **Doom Tower Hard Bosses:** Ninja stacks on Boss, deals increasing damage as fight progresses
- **Arena:** Ninja stacks slowly (10 cycles on champions), not ideal for fast Arena clears (better for sustain/tanky Arena teams)

**Investment Priority:** **Passive (no books required)** - Automatically active. Build Ninja with defensive stats (HP, DEF, ACC) for survivability, then let passive boost damage over time.

**Arena (Priority 4):**

**Recommended Set: Savage/Lethal + Perception or Stoneskin**
- **Savage/Lethal (4-piece):** Ignore DEF or +18% C.DMG for nuking
- **Perception (2-piece):** +40 ACC for Freeze debuff reliability
- **Stoneskin (2-piece or 4-piece):** Grants Stone Skin buff (immunity to damage for first 2 hits)
- **Stat priorities:** 250+ ACC, 250+ SPD (Gold 4+), 100% C.RATE, 250%+ C.DMG, ATK% (passive provides +100% ATK after 10 cycles)

---

### Detailed Artifact Recommendations

**Banner:**
- **Accuracy (PRIMARY):** +40-80 ACC → Critical for landing Decrease DEF, HP Burn, Freeze debuffs
- **HP (ALTERNATIVE):** +5k-8k HP → Survivability for Clan Boss/Doom Tower Hard

**Chest:**
- **HP% (PRIMARY for Clan Boss/Doom Tower):** +50-60k HP → Survivability
- **ATK% (ALTERNATIVE for Arena/Dungeons):** +15-20% ATK → Higher base damage (passive provides +100% ATK, so ATK% chest is less critical than for other champions)
- **DEF% (ALTERNATIVE):** +800-1200 DEF → Survivability

**Boots:**
- **Speed (PRIMARY - ALWAYS):** +40-60 SPD → Turn cycling, skill frequency
- **HP% (ALTERNATIVE for tanky builds):** +50-60k HP → Survivability (only if speed is sufficient from substats)

**Gloves:**
- **Crit Rate (PRIMARY if < 100% C.RATE):** +50-60% C.RATE → Warmaster/Giant Slayer proc rate
- **Crit Damage (PRIMARY if 100% C.RATE):** +50-70% C.DMG → Damage scaling
- **HP% (ALTERNATIVE for tanky builds):** +50-60k HP → Survivability

**Weapon/Helmet/Shield (Stat Priorities):**
- **Speed (PRIMARY):** +20-30 SPD total across all 3 pieces → Reach 220+ SPD for Clan Boss/Dungeons
- **Accuracy (HIGH):** +40-80 ACC total → Reach 250+ ACC for Clan Boss, 350+ ACC for Doom Tower Hard
- **HP (MEDIUM):** +10k-20k HP total → Survivability
- **DEF (MEDIUM):** +500-800 DEF total → Survivability
- **Crit Rate (LOW if using C.RATE gloves):** +10-20% C.RATE → Reach 100% C.RATE total
- **Crit Damage (LOW):** +20-40% C.DMG → Passive provides +25% C.DMG, so less critical than for other champions

## 5. Masteries

### Clan Boss UNM Masteries (PRIMARY)

**Offense Tree (LEFT):**

**Tier 1:**
- **Deadly Precision** (4/4): +8% C.RATE → Helps reach 100% C.RATE

**Tier 2:**
- **Keen Strike** (3/3): +10% damage to enemies with debuffs → Synergizes with Decrease DEF, HP Burn

**Tier 3:**
- **Heart of Glory** (3/3): +20% damage when HP > 60% → High uptime in Clan Boss

**Tier 4:**
- **Life Drinker** (3/3): Heal for 10% of damage dealt → Slight sustain (less critical if using Lifesteal set)
- **Single Out** (3/3): +15% damage to single-target enemies → Excellent for Clan Boss (Boss is always alone)

**Tier 5:**
- **Bring it Down** (3/3): +20% damage to enemies with 50%+ HP → High uptime in Clan Boss

**Tier 6:**
- **Warmaster (RECOMMENDED)** (1/1): 60% chance to deal 10% Enemy MAX HP damage (4% vs Clan Boss) → **BEST choice for Ninja** (A2 activates HP Burns, Warmaster adds extra MAX HP damage)
  * **Expected damage per skill:** A1 (1 hit): 2.4% MAX HP, A2 (3 hits): 7.2% MAX HP, A3 (1 hit): 2.4% MAX HP
- **Giant Slayer (ALTERNATIVE)** (1/1): 30% chance to deal 7.5% Enemy MAX HP damage (4% vs Clan Boss) on each hit of multi-hit skills
  * **A2 (3 hits) probability:** 65.7% chance of at least 1 proc (NOT 90% - calculated as 1 - (0.70)³ = 0.657), or 0.9 expected procs per A2 use
  * **Expected damage per skill:** A1 (1 hit): 1.2% MAX HP, A2 (3 hits): 3.6% MAX HP, A3 (1 hit): 1.2% MAX HP
  * **Verdict:** Warmaster is superior for ALL of Ninja's skills (A1: 2.4% > 1.2%, A2: 7.2% > 3.6%, A3: 2.4% > 1.2%)

**CRITICAL: Warmaster/Giant Slayer C.RATE Dependency**

Warmaster and Giant Slayer masteries **ONLY proc on critical hits**:
- **Effective Proc Rate = C.RATE × Base Proc Rate**
- **Warmaster:** 60% base → 60% at 100% C.RATE, 51% at 85% C.RATE (15% damage loss)
- **Giant Slayer:** 30% base → 30% at 100% C.RATE, 25.5% at 85% C.RATE (15% damage loss)

**Why 100% C.RATE is CRITICAL for Ninja:**
- At 85% C.RATE (current build), you lose 15% of expected mastery damage:
  * Warmaster A2: 7.2% → 6.12% MAX HP (15% loss)
  * Giant Slayer A2: 3.6% → 3.06% MAX HP (15% loss)
- At 70% C.RATE, you lose 30% of expected mastery damage
- **Recommendation:** Prioritize 100% C.RATE via Gloves (C.RATE main stat) + substats before other offensive stats (C.DMG, ATK)

**Offense Tree:** T1-T6 complete path to Warmaster

### Key Mastery Notes

1. **Warmaster vs Giant Slayer:**
   - **Warmaster (RECOMMENDED):** 60% chance to deal 10% Enemy MAX HP damage (4% vs Clan Boss)
     * Expected damage: A1 (1 hit) = 2.4% MAX HP, A2 (3 hits) = 7.2% MAX HP, A3 (1 hit) = 2.4% MAX HP
   - **Giant Slayer:** 30% chance to deal 7.5% Enemy MAX HP damage (4% vs Clan Boss) per hit of multi-hit skills
     * A2 (3 hits): 65.7% chance of at least 1 proc (calculated as 1 - (0.70)³), or 0.9 expected procs per use
     * Expected damage: A1 (1 hit) = 1.2% MAX HP, A2 (3 hits) = 3.6% MAX HP, A3 (1 hit) = 1.2% MAX HP
   - **Verdict:** Warmaster is superior for Ninja (better for ALL skills: A1 [2.4% > 1.2%], A2 [7.2% > 3.6%], A3 [2.4% > 1.2%])

2. **Master Hexer vs Sniper:**
   - **Master Hexer (RECOMMENDED):** Extends HP Burn from 3 turns to 4 turns (10% chance per debuff) → More HP Burn activations per fight
   - **Sniper:** +50% ACC when attacking Boss → Helps reach 250+ ACC (only useful if ACC is low from gear)
   - **Verdict:** Master Hexer is superior if ACC is sufficient (250+), Sniper is useful for early-game players with low ACC

3. **Opportunist (Arena only):**
   - +12% damage to enemies under Freeze, Sleep, Stun, etc. → Synergizes with Ninja's A3 Freeze
   - **Only take for Arena builds** (not useful for Clan Boss/Dungeons)

## 6. Faction Wars Advice

### Owned Champions in Shadowkin Faction

**Total Owned Shadowkin Champions:** 1 (Ninja only)

**Current Roster:**
- **Ninja** (Legendary, Magic): HP Burn, AOE Freeze, Decrease DEF

**Faction Wars Team Recommendations:**

**Current Status:** Insufficient roster for Shadowkin Faction Wars (only 1 champion). Ninja alone cannot complete Faction Wars stages (requires 5 champions).

**Priority:** **LOW** - User prioritizes completing Lizardmen, Knights Revenant, High Elf, Dark Elf (near-completion factions) before starting Shadowkin Faction Wars.

---

### Ideal 5-Champion Pull List (Non-Owned Only)

**Priority:** Pull these Shadowkin champions to build a viable Faction Wars team:

**1. Yumeko (Legendary, Force) - CRITICAL**
- **Role:** Speed lead (30% SPD in Arena), TM boost, Increase ATK, Revive
- **Rationale:** Shadowkin faction lacks Speed lead and TM control. Yumeko provides both, enabling faster turn cycling and team setup.
- **Impact:** Game-changing for Shadowkin Faction Wars (Speed lead + Revive)

**2. Fenax (Epic, Magic) - HIGH**
- **Role:** Block Revive, Decrease DEF, Increase ACC, passive healing
- **Rationale:** Block Revive is critical for Faction Wars bosses (prevents boss revives). Decrease DEF synergizes with Ninja.
- **Impact:** Enables boss kill strategies (Block Revive prevents boss mechanics)

**3. Burangiri (Epic, Spirit) - HIGH**
- **Role:** Ally Protection, Strengthen, Increase DEF, Shield
- **Rationale:** Shadowkin lacks strong tank/sustain champions. Burangiri provides Ally Protection (redirects damage) and Shield for survivability.
- **Impact:** Increases team survivability in Faction Wars

**4. Hotatsu (Legendary, Void) - MEDIUM**
- **Role:** AOE Stun, AOE Freeze, TM control, Decrease ACC
- **Rationale:** Provides additional crowd control (AOE Stun + Freeze) to complement Ninja's AOE Freeze. TM control prevents enemy attacks.
- **Impact:** Excellent wave control + boss control

**5. Chani (Epic, Void) - MEDIUM**
- **Role:** AOE Decrease DEF, AOE Weaken, Continuous Heal
- **Rationale:** AOE Decrease DEF (60%, 2 turns) synergizes with Ninja's HP Burn and damage output. Continuous Heal provides sustain.
- **Impact:** Increases team damage (Decrease DEF + Weaken) + sustain

---

### Shadowkin Faction Wars Strategy (When Roster Complete)

**Recommended Team Composition:**
1. **Yumeko (Speed lead, TM boost, Revive)**
2. **Ninja (HP Burn, AOE Freeze, Decrease DEF)**
3. **Fenax (Block Revive, Decrease DEF, healing)**
4. **Burangiri (Ally Protection, Shield, Increase DEF)**
5. **Chani (AOE Decrease DEF, Weaken, Continuous Heal)**

**Strategy:**
- **Yumeko:** Speed lead + TM boost → Team goes first, sets up debuffs
- **Fenax + Ninja:** Double Decrease DEF (60% from both) → High uptime on Decrease DEF
- **Ninja:** HP Burn + AOE Freeze → Damage + wave control
- **Burangiri:** Ally Protection on Ninja/Yumeko → Redirects damage to tank
- **Chani:** AOE Decrease DEF + Weaken → Boosts team damage, Continuous Heal sustains team

**Expected Stages Cleared:** Normal 1-21 (with full team at 60, ascended, booked), Hard 1-10 (requires better gear)

---

## 7. Team Synergies & Pairings

### Best Champions to Pair With (Owned Roster Only)

**Clan Boss UNM (Priority 1):**

**Option A: Unkillable Team with Triple Pain Keeper (BEST)**

**Core Team:**
1. **Pain Keeper (x3)** - Cooldown reduction (A2), Increase SPD, Heal
2. **Ninja** - HP Burn activation (A2), Decrease DEF (A1), passive damage scaling
3. **Warcaster / Maneater** - Block Damage (unkillable buff)

**Synergy:**
- Pain Keeper's A2 reduces all cooldowns by 1 turn → Ninja uses A2 (HP Burn activation) more frequently
- Triple Pain Keeper = near-permanent cooldown reduction → Ninja can use A2 every 1-2 turns (instead of 3-turn CD)
- Warcaster/Maneater provides Block Damage → Team survives indefinitely
- Ninja's Decrease DEF (A1) + HP Burn activation (A2) = primary damage source

**Expected Damage:** 30-50M+ per key (UNM)

---

**Option B: HP Burn Stack Team (Artak + Ninja + Geomancer)**

**Core Team:**
1. **Artak** - HP Burn (A2, single-target, 3-turn duration, 3-turn CD)
2. **Ninja** - HP Burn activation (A2, activates all HP Burns on Boss)
3. **Geomancer** - HP Burn (Passive, 2-turn duration, activates when hit)
4. **Brogni** - Unremovable Shield + Block Debuffs + Reflect Damage
5. **Godseeker Aniri / Rector Drath** - Revive, Cleanse, Ally Protection

**Synergy:**
- **Artak places HP Burn (A2) → Geomancer places HP Burn (Passive) → Ninja activates ALL HP Burns (A2)**
- Each HP Burn activation deals 7.5% Enemy MAX HP damage (ignores 100% DEF)
- Example: 2 HP Burns activated = 2 × 7.5% = 15% Enemy MAX HP damage per Ninja A2
- Brogni provides Unremovable Shield + Block Debuffs → Team survives Clan Boss AOE attacks
- Godseeker Aniri / Rector Drath provides Revive + Cleanse → Safety net

**Expected Damage:** 20-40M+ per key (UNM)

---

**Dungeons (Priority 2):**

**Option A: HP Burn Team (Dragon 25, Ice Golem 25)**

**Core Team:**
1. **Ninja** - HP Burn activation (A2), AOE Freeze (A3), Decrease DEF (A1)
2. **Artak** - HP Burn (A2), AOE Decrease DEF (A3)
3. **Scyl of the Drakes** - AOE Stun (A2), Revive (A3), Passive healing
4. **Arbiter** - Speed lead (30% Arena), TM boost (30%), Revive (A2), Increase ATK (A3)
5. **Wukong** - Speed lead (30% Arena), Buff strip (A2), Nuke (A3), Sheep control (Passive)

**Synergy:**
- **Arbiter / Wukong:** Speed lead + TM boost → Team goes first
- **Ninja + Artak:** HP Burn + HP Burn activation → High boss damage
- **Scyl:** AOE Stun for wave control + Revive safety net
- **Wukong:** Buff strip for bosses with buffs (Dragon)

**Expected Clear Time:** 2-3 minutes (Dragon 25), 2-4 minutes (Ice Golem 25)

---

**Option B: Freeze Control Team (Bommal Dreadbombs - Doom Tower Hard)**

**Core Team:**
1. **Ninja** - AOE Freeze (A3), HP Burn activation (A2), Decrease DEF (A1)
2. **Scyl of the Drakes** - AOE Stun (A2), Revive (A3), Passive healing
3. **Brogni** - Unremovable Shield + Block Debuffs + Reflect Damage
4. **Godseeker Aniri** - Ally Protection + Shield + Revive + Cleanse
5. **Rector Drath** - Revive + Heal + Cleanse + Block Debuffs

**Synergy:**
- **Ninja:** AOE Freeze reduces Dreadbomb explosion damage by 50% (Frozen debuff effect) → **CRITICAL mechanic for Bommal**
- **Scyl:** AOE Stun for additional control (Stun + Freeze = 2 control layers)
- **Brogni:** Unremovable Shield + Block Debuffs → Prevents Bommal's debuffs (Decrease DEF, Weaken)
- **Godseeker Aniri + Rector Drath:** Ally Protection + Shield + Revive → Triple safety net

**Expected Clear:** Bommal Hard 1-90 (manual play required for Freeze timing)

---

**Arena (Priority 4):**

**Core Arena Team (User's Confirmed Setup):**
1. **Wukong** - Speed lead (30% Arena), Buff strip (A2), Nuke (A3), Sheep control (Passive)
2. **Mythrala** - Buffs/Cleanse, Hex damage
3. **Loki** - Control, Buff strip, Suppress mythics/active skills
4. **Flex spot:** Ninja (AOE Freeze control), Arbiter (Speed lead + TM boost), Michelangelo (Decrease DEF + Weaken), Coldheart (TM control + MAX HP damage)

**Synergy:**
- **Wukong:** Speed lead + Buff strip + Nuke → Primary offense
- **Mythrala:** Buffs/Cleanse + Hex damage → Support + secondary damage
- **Loki:** Control + Buff strip + Suppress → Prevents enemy Arbiter Revive, Mythic active skills
- **Ninja (Flex):** AOE Freeze control (100% chance booked) → Locks enemy team for 1 turn, allows allies to attack safely

**Expected Win Rate:** 70-80% offense (Gold 3), 50-60% offense (Gold 4+)

### Similar Champions with Comparable Utility (Owned Roster Only)

**HP Burn Champions:**

| Champion | HP Burn Rating | HP Burn Mechanic | Activation on Boss? | Notes |
|----------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Artak** | 10/10 | A2 (single-target, 100% chance booked, 3-turn duration, 3-turn CD) | No | BEST HP Burn - consistent placement, excellent uptime |
| **Ninja** | 9/10 | A2 (3 random targets, 100% chance booked, 3-turn duration, 3-turn CD) | **YES (instant activation)** | UNIQUE HP Burn activation - instantly activates all HP Burns on Boss |
| **Geomancer** | 9/10 | Passive (when hit, 100% chance, 2-turn duration) | No | Tied with Ninja - passive HP Burn, excellent uptime |
| **Akoth the Seared** | 7/10 | A3 (AOE, 100% chance booked, 2-turn duration, 4-turn CD) | No | AOE HP Burn, longer CD than Artak/Ninja |
| **Drexthar Bloodtwin** | 7/10 | Passive (when attacked, 50% chance, 2-turn duration) | No | Passive HP Burn, 50% proc rate |

**Freeze/Control Champions:**

| Champion | Control Rating | Control Mechanic | Duration | AOE? | Notes |
|----------|----------------|------------------|----------|------|-------|
| **Ninja** | 10/10 | A3 (AOE Freeze, 100% chance booked, 1-turn duration) | 1 turn | YES | ONLY owned champion with AOE Freeze |
| **Loki** | 9/10 | A3 (AOE Sleep, 100% chance, 2-turn duration) | 2 turns | YES | Sleep (breaks on damage), but 2-turn duration |
| **Scyl of the Drakes** | 8/10 | A2 (AOE Stun, 30% chance, 1-turn duration) | 1 turn | YES | Stun (not Freeze), 30% proc chance |
| **Akoth the Seared** | 6/10 | Passive (25% Fear when HP Burn activates, 1-turn duration) | 1 turn | Single-target | Fear (not Freeze), 25% proc chance |

**Decrease DEF Champions:**

| Champion | Decrease DEF Rating | Decrease DEF Mechanic | Uptime | AOE? | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|------|-------|
| **Dhukk the Pierced** | 10/10 | A3 (AOE, 100% chance, 60% Decrease DEF, 3-turn duration, 4-turn CD) | Excellent | YES | BEST Decrease DEF - AOE, 3-turn duration |
| **Stag Knight** | 9/10 | A3 (AOE, 100% chance, 60% Decrease DEF, 2-turn duration, 4-turn CD) | Good | YES | AOE Decrease DEF + Decrease SPD |
| **Tayrel** | 9/10 | A1 (single-target, 100% chance, 60% Decrease DEF, 2-turn duration) | Excellent | No | Single-target, near-permanent uptime (A1) |
| **Deacon Armstrong** | 9/10 | A3 (AOE, 100% chance, 60% Decrease DEF, 2-turn duration, 4-turn CD) | Good | YES | AOE Decrease DEF + TM boost |
| **Ninja** | 7/10 | A1 (single-target, 60% chance booked, 60% Decrease DEF, 2-turn duration) | Good | No | Single-target, 60% proc chance (not 100%) |

**Verdict:** Ninja's Decrease DEF is decent (7/10), but better options exist (Dhukk, Stag Knight, Tayrel, Deacon). **Ninja's primary value is HP Burn activation + AOE Freeze, NOT Decrease DEF.**

---

### Cheese Strategy Potential (If Applicable)

**N/A - Ninja does not enable cheese strategies.**

Ninja is a **straightforward HP Burn activation + AOE Freeze champion**. He does not have unique mechanics that enable cheese strategies (e.g., Unkillable, Ally Attack spam, MAX HP damage spam, passive sustain cheese).

**However, Ninja PARTICIPATES in cheese strategies:**
- **Triple Pain Keeper Unkillable Cheese (Clan Boss UNM):** Ninja is the primary damage dealer in Triple Pain Keeper unkillable teams (Pain Keeper x3 + Ninja + Warcaster/Maneater)
- **HP Burn Stack Cheese (Clan Boss UNM):** Ninja + Artak + Geomancer = Triple HP Burn placement + instant activation = massive MAX HP damage

---

## 8. Investment Recommendations

### Priority Level: **CRITICAL** (Clan Boss UNM > Dungeons > Doom Tower Hard)

**Rationale:**
- Ninja is **tied for 2nd-best HP Burn champion** among owned roster (9/10, tied with Geomancer, behind Artak 10/10)
- **UNIQUE HP Burn activation mechanic:** ONLY owned champion who can instantly activate HP Burns on Bosses (deals 7.5% Enemy MAX HP per activation, ignores 100% DEF)
- **ONLY owned champion with AOE Freeze:** Critical for Bommal Dreadbombs (Freeze reduces explosion damage by 50%)
- **Excellent for Unkillable Clan Boss teams:** Pairs with Triple Pain Keeper (x3 owned) for 30-50M+ damage per key (UNM)
- **Excellent for Dungeons:** HP Burn + Freeze + Decrease DEF = all-rounder for Dragon 25, Ice Golem 25, Fire Knight 25
- **Excellent for Doom Tower Hard:** HP Burn activation + Freeze for Bommal, Frost Spider, Celestial Griffin

- **Priority:** **HIGH** - 6-star Ninja FIRST if not already done
- **Reason:** Ninja requires survivability (50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF) for Clan Boss UNM and Doom Tower Hard. 6-star provides +15-20k HP and +500-800 DEF.

**Skill Books: CRITICAL (13 books total)**
- **A2 (Hailburn): 5 books → CRITICAL (Book FIRST)**
  * Level 4: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (85% HP Burn chance)
  * Level 5: Buff/Debuff Chance +15% (100% HP Burn chance, CRITICAL)
  * Level 6: Cooldown -1 (3-turn CD, CRITICAL)
  * **Reason:** A2 is Ninja's signature skill (HP Burn activation). 100% HP Burn chance and 3-turn CD are mandatory for Clan Boss UNM.

- **A3 (Cyan Slash): 6 books → HIGH (Book SECOND)**
  * Level 3: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (85% Freeze chance)
  * Level 4: Buff/Debuff Chance +15% (100% Freeze chance, HIGH)
  * Level 5: Cooldown -1 (4-turn CD, HIGH)
  * **Reason:** 100% Freeze chance is critical for Bommal (Dreadbomb mitigation). 4-turn CD reduces A2 cooldown by 1 turn (increases A2 frequency).

- **A1 (Shatterbolt): 4 books → MEDIUM (Book THIRD, if books available)**
  * Level 4: Buff/Debuff Chance +5% (50% Decrease DEF chance)
  * Level 5: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (60% Decrease DEF chance, MEDIUM)
  * **Reason:** 60% Decrease DEF is good, but not critical (better Decrease DEF champions exist: Dhukk 10/10, Stag Knight 9/10, Tayrel 9/10, Deacon 9/10).

**Partial Investment Guidance:**
- **Minimum (Clan Boss UNM):** Book A2 to 100% HP Burn chance + 3-turn CD (5 books)
- **Recommended (Doom Tower Hard):** Book A2 (5 books) + A3 to 100% Freeze chance + 4-turn CD (6 books) = 11 books total
- **Optimal (All Content):** Full booking (13 books total: A2 + A3 + A1)

**When to Stop Investment:**
- **NEVER stop at partial investment for Ninja** - He is CRITICAL priority for Clan Boss UNM (user's Priority 1 content)
- Book A2 + A3 at minimum (11 books), full booking (13 books) if books available

---

### PVE Disclaimer

**Ninja requires booking/building for optimal performance in:**
- **Clan Boss UNM (Priority 1):** Requires full booking (A2 + A3 minimum), 250+ ACC, 220+ SPD, 50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG
- **Dungeons (Priority 2):** Requires A2 + A3 booking, 200-250 ACC, 200+ SPD, 35k+ HP, 2k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 180%+ C.DMG
- **Doom Tower Hard (Priority 3):** Requires A2 + A3 booking, 350+ ACC (CRITICAL), 220+ SPD, 50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG

**Without booking:**
- A2 HP Burn chance drops to 75% (unreliable for Clan Boss)
- A2 cooldown remains 4 turns (reduces HP Burn activation frequency)
- A3 Freeze chance drops to 75% (unreliable for Bommal Dreadbomb mitigation)
- A3 cooldown remains 5 turns (reduces A2 cooldown reduction frequency)

**Verdict:** Ninja is **NOT viable** for Clan Boss UNM or Doom Tower Hard without booking A2 + A3 (11 books minimum).

### Gear Investment: CRITICAL

**Clan Boss UNM:**
- **Lifesteal + Speed (Early-Mid Game):** Farm Dragon 20+ for Lifesteal set (4-piece) + Speed set (2-piece)
- **Savage/Lethal + Perception (Late Game - Unkillable):** Farm Dragon 24-25 for Savage/Lethal set (4-piece) + Perception set (2-piece)
- **Target Stats:** 250+ ACC, 220+ SPD (or 171-191 SPD for Unkillable), 50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG

**Dungeons:**
- **Relentless + Speed (Auto-Friendly):** Farm Dragon 20+ or Fire Knight 20+ for Relentless set
- **Target Stats:** 200-250 ACC, 200+ SPD, 35k+ HP, 2k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 180%+ C.DMG

**Doom Tower Hard:**
- **Lifesteal + Perception:** Farm Dragon 20+ for Lifesteal + Perception
- **Target Stats:** 350+ ACC (CRITICAL), 220+ SPD, 50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG

---

### Masteries Investment: CRITICAL

**Cost:** 800 Gems (instant unlock) OR 500-800 Energy (manual farming Minotaur 15)

**Recommended:** Use 800 Gems to instant unlock **Warmaster (Tier 6 Offense)** + **Master Hexer (Tier 6 Support)**

**Rationale:**
- Warmaster (60% chance to deal 10% Enemy MAX HP damage) is Ninja's primary damage source in Clan Boss UNM (alongside HP Burn activation)
- Master Hexer (extends debuff duration by 1 turn) extends HP Burn from 3 turns to 4 turns (increases HP Burn activations per fight)

---

### Investment Timeline

**Week 1-2: 6-Star Ascension + Gear Farming**
- 6-star Ninja (farm food champions in Campaign 12-6)
- Farm Dragon 20+ for Lifesteal set (4-piece) + Speed set (2-piece) OR Perception set (2-piece)
- Target stats: 250+ ACC, 220+ SPD, 50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG

**Week 3-4: Skill Books (A2 + A3)**
- Book A2 to 100% HP Burn chance + 3-turn CD (5 books)
- Book A3 to 100% Freeze chance + 4-turn CD (6 books)
- **Total:** 11 books (A2 + A3)

**Week 5-6: Masteries**
- Use 800 Gems to instant unlock Warmaster + Master Hexer masteries
- OR farm Minotaur 15 (500-800 Energy)

**Week 7+: Testing & Optimization**
- Test Ninja in Clan Boss UNM (aim for 30-50M+ damage per key)
- Test Ninja in Dungeons (Dragon 25, Ice Golem 25, Fire Knight 25)
- Test Ninja in Doom Tower Hard (Bommal, Frost Spider, Celestial Griffin)
- Optimize gear based on testing results (increase ACC to 350+ for Doom Tower Hard, increase C.DMG to 250%+ for higher damage)

---

### Optimization Output

**Example (Hypothetical Build):**

**Input:**
- Current Level: 60 / 60
- Current Ascension: 6 / 6 stars
- Skills Booked: A2 (3 / 5 books), A3 (0 / 6 books), A1 (0 / 4 books)
- Current Gear Sets: Lifesteal (4-piece) + Speed (2-piece)
- Current Stats: HP 45k, ATK 3k, DEF 2k, SPD 200, C.RATE 85%, C.DMG 150%, ACC 180, RESIST 100
- Current Masteries: Partial (T1-T5 complete, no T6 Warmaster/Master Hexer)
- Current Primary Use: Clan Boss UNM

**Optimization Advice:**

**Priority 1: Book A2 to 100% HP Burn chance + 3-turn CD (2 more books needed)**
- Current A2: 85% HP Burn chance, 4-turn CD → Unreliable for Clan Boss UNM
- Target A2: 100% HP Burn chance, 3-turn CD → Mandatory for Clan Boss UNM
- **Impact:** +15% HP Burn reliability, +33% A2 frequency (4-turn CD → 3-turn CD)

**Priority 2: Increase ACC to 250+ (current: 180)**
- Current ACC: 180 → 30% chance to miss debuffs on Clan Boss UNM (250 ACC required)
- Target ACC: 250+ → 0% chance to miss debuffs
- **How to fix:** Replace Resist stat gear pieces with ACC stat gear pieces (Banner, Chest, Weapon/Helmet/Shield substats)

**Priority 3: Increase C.RATE to 100% (current: 85%)**
- Current C.RATE: 85% → Warmaster proc rate is 85% × 60% = 51% per hit
- Target C.RATE: 100% → Warmaster proc rate is 100% × 60% = 60% per hit
- **How to fix:** Replace ATK% Gloves with C.RATE Gloves, or improve C.RATE substats on Weapon/Helmet/Shield

**Priority 4: Increase C.DMG to 200%+ (current: 150%)**
- Current C.DMG: 150% → Low damage output (Ninja's passive provides +25% C.DMG, so 150% base = 175% total)
- Target C.DMG: 200%+ → Higher damage output (200% base + 25% passive = 225% total)
- **How to fix:** Replace HP% Gloves with C.DMG Gloves (once C.RATE reaches 100%), or improve C.DMG substats

**Priority 5: Unlock Warmaster + Master Hexer masteries (current: None)**
- Current Masteries: Partial (T1-T5 complete, no T6)
- Target Masteries: Warmaster (Tier 6 Offense) + Master Hexer (Tier 6 Support)
- **How to fix:** Use 800 Gems to instant unlock masteries, OR farm Minotaur 15 (500-800 Energy)

**Priority 6: Book A3 to 100% Freeze chance + 4-turn CD (6 books needed)**
- Current A3: 75% Freeze chance, 5-turn CD → Unreliable for Doom Tower Hard (Bommal)
- Target A3: 100% Freeze chance, 4-turn CD → Mandatory for Doom Tower Hard
- **Impact:** +25% Freeze reliability, +20% A3 frequency (5-turn CD → 4-turn CD)

**Priority 7: Increase SPD to 220+ (current: 200)**
- Current SPD: 200 → Low turn frequency (fewer A2 activations per fight)
- Target SPD: 220+ → Higher turn frequency (more A2 activations per fight)
- **How to fix:** Replace HP% Boots with SPD Boots, or improve SPD substats on all gear pieces

**Expected Impact After Optimization:**
- Clan Boss UNM damage: 15-20M per key (current) → 30-50M+ per key (optimized)
- HP Burn uptime: 70-80% (current, 85% chance) → 95-100% (optimized, 100% chance + 3-turn CD)
- Warmaster proc rate: 51% per hit (current, 85% C.RATE) → 60% per hit (optimized, 100% C.RATE)

## 10. Cheese Strategy Integration

**Ninja does NOT enable standalone cheese strategies**, but he **participates** in the following cheese strategies:

---

### Cheese Strategy 1: Triple Pain Keeper Unkillable (Clan Boss UNM)

**Cheese Type:** Unkillable Cheese (Block Damage spam)

**Required Champions:**
- **Pain Keeper (x3)** - Cooldown reduction (A2), Increase SPD, Heal
- **Ninja** - HP Burn activation (A2), Decrease DEF (A1), passive damage scaling
- **Warcaster / Maneater** - Block Damage (unkillable buff)

**Cheese Viability:** **CRITICAL** (Best option for Clan Boss UNM)

**Safety Level:** **SAFE** (Consistent, reliable, 100% success rate when speed-tuned)

**Content Applications:** Clan Boss UNM (30-50M+ damage per key)

**Setup Requirements:**
1. **Speed Tuning (CRITICAL):**
   - Pain Keeper #1: 241-245 SPD (A2 cooldown reduction on turn 1, 3, 5, 7, ...)
   - Pain Keeper #2: 220-224 SPD (A2 cooldown reduction on turn 2, 4, 6, 8, ...)
   - Pain Keeper #3: 199-203 SPD (A2 cooldown reduction on turn 1, 3, 5, 7, ...)
   - Ninja: 171-191 SPD (damage dealer, goes last)
   - Warcaster/Maneater: 171-191 SPD (Block Damage, goes before Ninja)

2. **Gear:**
   - **Ninja:** Savage/Lethal + Perception (250+ ACC, 171-191 SPD, 100% C.RATE, 250%+ C.DMG)
   - **Pain Keeper (x3):** Speed + Perception (250+ ACC, speed-tuned as above)
   - **Warcaster/Maneater:** Speed + Immortal (250+ ACC, 171-191 SPD, HP/DEF for survivability)

3. **Skill Order (Auto):**
   - Pain Keeper #1: A2 (cooldown reduction) → A1 (filler)
   - Pain Keeper #2: A2 (cooldown reduction) → A1 (filler)
   - Pain Keeper #3: A2 (cooldown reduction) → A1 (filler)
   - Warcaster/Maneater: A3 (Block Damage) → A1 (filler)
   - Ninja: A2 (HP Burn activation) → A3 (Ignore DEF + reduce A2 CD) → A1 (Decrease DEF + TM boost)

**Expected Results:**
- **Damage:** 30-50M+ per key (UNM)
- **Clear Time:** 50 turns (full Clan Boss fight, team survives indefinitely)
- **Success Rate:** 100% (when speed-tuned correctly)

**Prioritization Rule:** **Triple Pain Keeper Unkillable is STRICTLY BETTER than conventional Clan Boss teams** (higher damage, 100% success rate, no RNG). Prioritize this cheese if you own Pain Keeper x3.

**Cross-Reference to Boss Guides:** See `Notes/ClanBoss_UltraNightmare_Team_Notes_FINAL.md`, Section: "Triple Pain Keeper Unkillable Cheese"

---

### Cheese Strategy 2: HP Burn Stack Cheese (Clan Boss UNM)

**Cheese Type:** HP Burn Stack (Artak + Ninja + Geomancer)

**Required Champions:**
- **Artak** - HP Burn (A2, single-target, 3-turn duration, 3-turn CD)
- **Ninja** - HP Burn activation (A2, activates all HP Burns on Boss)
- **Geomancer** - HP Burn (Passive, 2-turn duration, activates when hit)
- **Brogni** - Unremovable Shield + Block Debuffs + Reflect Damage
- **Godseeker Aniri / Rector Drath** - Revive, Cleanse, Ally Protection

**Cheese Viability:** **HIGH** (Strong option, but not as safe as Triple Pain Keeper Unkillable)

**Safety Level:** **RISKY** (Requires strong sustain, vulnerable to RNG if Brogni's Shield drops)

**Content Applications:** Clan Boss UNM (20-40M+ damage per key)

**Setup Requirements:**
1. **Gear:**
   - **Ninja:** Lifesteal + Perception (250+ ACC, 220+ SPD, 50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG)
   - **Artak:** Lifesteal + Perception (250+ ACC, 220+ SPD, 50k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG)
   - **Geomancer:** Lifesteal + Perception (250+ ACC, 220+ SPD, 60k+ HP, 3k+ DEF, 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG)
   - **Brogni:** Speed + Immortal (250+ ACC, 250+ SPD, 70k+ HP, 3.5k+ DEF)
   - **Godseeker Aniri / Rector Drath:** Speed + Immortal (200+ ACC, 220+ SPD, 60k+ HP, 3k+ DEF)

2. **Skill Order (Manual):**
   - Turn 1: Artak A2 (place HP Burn on Boss) → Geomancer gets hit by Boss (place HP Burn on Boss via Passive) → Ninja A2 (activate all HP Burns)
   - Turn 2-50: Repeat cycle (Artak A2 → Geomancer Passive → Ninja A2)

**Expected Results:**
- **Damage:** 20-40M+ per key (UNM)
- **Clear Time:** 50 turns (full Clan Boss fight, if team survives)
- **Success Rate:** 70-80% (vulnerable to RNG if Brogni's Shield drops or if Geomancer doesn't get hit by Boss)

**Prioritization Rule:** **HP Burn Stack Cheese is GOOD, but NOT as safe as Triple Pain Keeper Unkillable.** Use if you don't have Pain Keeper x3, or if you want to experiment with different team compositions.

**Cross-Reference to Boss Guides:** See `Notes/ClanBoss_UltraNightmare_Team_Notes_FINAL.md`, Section: "HP Burn Stack Team"
