## 1. Champion Overview

### Summary

**Arbiter** is the pinnacle support champion in RAID Shadow Legends and the ultimate reward for completing the Progress Mission chain. Clad in resplendent white and gold armor with flowing scarlet hair, she embodies both divinity and command. As Lumaya's eternal protector, Arbiter is more than just a legendary champion—she is a complete team enabler who reshapes the battlefield through her unmatched support capabilities.

Her toolkit makes her one of the most important champions in the game. With **Gaze of Justice (A1)**, Arbiter strikes twice and has a 50% chance to place Weaken (fully booked), allowing allies to carve through enemies with greater efficiency. **Enforced Humility (A2)** disrupts enemy defenses by reducing the duration of their buffs, a crucial ability against teams and bosses that rely on layered protections.

Her signature move, **Mentor of Heroes (A3)**, lifts entire teams by filling Turn Meters by 30%, applying Increase Attack, and healing allies who have fallen below 50% HP. This trifecta of support makes Arbiter the ultimate pace setter, giving her side the chance to seize initiative and overwhelm opponents.

The heartbeat of her power comes from **Destiny's Call (A4)**. This revival not only restores all fallen allies to fighting form with 35% HP and 20% Turn Meter boosts, but also grants Arbiter an extra turn, ensuring she can immediately follow with another skill. Combined with her **30% Speed Aura** for Arena, Arbiter becomes the cornerstone of "go first" strategies. She ensures her team acts before the enemy, dictates the flow of combat, and transforms seemingly dire situations into sudden victories.

What makes Arbiter so essential is the completeness of her design. She heals, she revives, she empowers, and she accelerates, all while weakening enemies and dismantling their buffs. Her presence alone elevates any roster, whether in Arena, Dungeons, Doom Tower, or Clan Boss. Many champions are powerful, but few reshape the battlefield as Arbiter does. She is not simply a High Elf of legend—she is Teleria's eternal pulse, the keystone of countless victories, and the champion who ensures that hope always rises again.

### Obtainability

**Primary Source:**
- **Progress Missions (Guaranteed)**: Complete all Progress Missions (typically 6-12 months for F2P players)
- **Void Shards**: Extremely rare pull from Void Shards (0.5% chance per shard)

**Recommended Path:** Progress Missions are the guaranteed method. Focus on:
- Arena progression (Gold IV rank required for missions)
- Great Hall leveling (Level 10 in any stat required)
- Faction Wars progression (complete all factions on Normal)
- Champion collection and leveling milestones

### Role Classification

**Primary Roles:**
- **Turn Meter Booster** (30% TM fill on A3, 20% TM fill on A4 revive)
- **Speed Aura Lead** (30% SPD in Arena—one of the best in the game)
- **Reviver** (All allies revive to 35% HP on A4)
- **Buffer** (50% Increase ATK on A3)
- **Healer** (25% MAX HP heal on A3 for allies below 50% HP)
- **Debuffer** (25% Weaken on A1, Decrease Buff Duration on A2)

**Secondary Roles:**
- **Damage Amplification** (Weaken + Increase ATK = massive damage boost)
- **Buff Control** (A2 decreases enemy buff duration by 1 turn)
- **Arena Speed Lead** (30% SPD aura = go-first teams)

## 2. Content-Specific Ratings (X/10 Contextualized)

**CRITICAL VALIDATION NOTE:** All ratings are contextualized to **OWNED champions** and validated by fetching Ayumilove/HellHades data. Ratings reflect Arbiter's performance relative to the user's current roster.

### Priority 1: Clan Boss UNM

**Rating: 8/10** (Excellent support, but outclassed by unkillable/speed tune teams for damage optimization)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * Turn Meter boost (A3) enables more attacks per turn = more damage output
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts ally damage significantly
  * Weaken debuff (25% on A1) increases damage taken by boss (pairs with Decrease DEF)
  * Revive (A4) saves runs from wipes (AI targeting, RNG)
  * Void affinity = safe vs all Clan Boss affinities (no weak hits)
- **Weaknesses:**
  * Does NOT contribute to unkillable/speed tune team compositions (no Block Damage, Increase DEF, etc.)
  * Lower priority than Brogni (shields), Godseeker Aniri (revive + Ally Protection), or dedicated poisoners/HP burners
  * A3 cooldown (3 turns fully booked) = less frequent TM boosts compared to Apothecary (A3 every 3 turns)
  * A4 revive is reactive (doesn't prevent deaths like Ally Protection or Unkillable)
- **Owned Champions Comparison:**
  * **Better for UNM Clan Boss:** Brogni (shields + Ally Protection), Pain Keeper (unkillable cheese), Frozen Banshee (poison spam)
  * **Similar utility:** Godseeker Aniri (revive + Ally Protection + heal), but Arbiter has better TM manipulation
  * **Worse for UNM Clan Boss:** Relickeeper (low utility), Shaman (poor revive)

**Why 8/10 instead of 10/10:**
Arbiter excels in general support but does NOT fit optimized Clan Boss strategies (unkillable, speed tune, ally attack spam). For **YOUR roster**, Brogni (shields + Ally Protection) and Pain Keeper (unkillable cheese) are superior for UNM Clan Boss. However, Arbiter is CRITICAL for progressing TO UNM (early/mid-game teams benefit immensely from her TM boost + revive).

**PVE Disclaimer:** Arbiter requires **full skill booking (A3 + A4 cooldown reduction)** and **high Speed (220-250+ SPD)** for optimal Clan Boss performance. Without books, her A3 cooldown is 4 turns (too slow for UNM).

**User-Specific Note:** 
- **OWNED: Brogni, Pain Keeper (x3), Godseeker Aniri** = Arbiter is backup/alternate for UNM Clan Boss
- **Priority:** Build Arbiter for Arena FIRST, then adapt for Clan Boss if needed

### Priority 2: Dungeons (All Stages 25)

#### Dragon 25

**Rating: 10/10** (Best-in-class TM booster + revive for Dragon 25 in owned roster—VALIDATED)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * Turn Meter boost (30% on A3) enables faster wave clear and more boss attacks per rotation
  * Revive (A4) saves runs from Dragon breath wipes (especially on trash waves)
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts HP Burn damage (Artak, Ninja, Geomancer, Akoth, Drexthar owned)
  * Weaken debuff (25% on A1) stacks with Decrease DEF for massive damage amplification
  * Void affinity = safe vs Magic Dragon (no weak hits)
  * A3 heal (25% MAX HP) keeps team healthy through trash waves
- **Weaknesses:**
  * Does NOT provide HP Burn (user has 5 HP Burn champions: Artak, Ninja, Geomancer, Akoth, Drexthar)
  * Does NOT provide Decrease DEF (user has Dhukk the Pierced, Stag Knight, Alure)
  * Requires high Speed (220-250+ SPD) to go first before trash wave attacks
- **Owned Champions Comparison (VALIDATED):**
  * **Arbiter vs Apothecary (Rare, Magic):** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% TM boost + revive + Increase ATK + heal vs Apothecary 15% TM boost + heal only)
  * **Arbiter vs Vogoth (Epic, Force):** Arbiter SUPERIOR (offensive support + TM boost vs Vogoth defensive sustain)
  * **Arbiter vs Godseeker Aniri (Epic, Spirit):** Arbiter SUPERIOR for SPEED (30% TM boost + extra turn on revive vs Godseeker single revive)

**Why 10/10:**
Arbiter is **best-in-class Turn Meter booster** in owned roster for Dragon 25. No other owned champion provides 30% TM boost + revive + Increase ATK + heal in a single kit. Apothecary (15% TM boost) and Godseeker Aniri (revive only) are inferior for speed farming. Arbiter enables 2-minute Dragon 25 runs with HP Burn teams.

**User Team Context:**
- **Current Dragon 25 team:** Artak (HP Burn), Ninja (HP Burn), Dhukk the Pierced (Decrease DEF), + 2 flex
- **With Arbiter:** Replace 1 flex with Arbiter → faster wave clear + revive safety net

---

#### Spider 25

**Rating: 9/10** (Excellent TM booster + revive, slightly behind specialized Spider nukers)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * Turn Meter boost (30% on A3) enables more Coldheart A3 nukes per rotation (MAX HP damage)
  * Revive (A4) saves runs from Spiderling swarm wipes
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts Coldheart/Sethalia/Akoth MAX HP damage
  * Weaken debuff (25% on A1) increases damage taken by Spider boss
  * Void affinity = safe vs Spirit Spider (no weak hits)
- **Weaknesses:**
  * Does NOT provide MAX HP damage (user has Coldheart x2, Sethalia, Royal Guard, Akoth)
  * Does NOT provide Turn Meter control (user has Armiger x2, Coldheart x2, Alure)
  * User confirmed: "Spider team confirmed strong" = Arbiter may not be needed
- **Owned Champions Comparison (VALIDATED):**
  * **Arbiter vs Apothecary:** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% TM boost vs 15% TM boost)
  * **Arbiter vs Paragon (Rare, Void):** Different roles (Arbiter TM boost vs Paragon unkillable cheese)
  * **Arbiter vs CH (x2) + Sethalia:** Different roles (Arbiter TM boost vs CH/Sethalia MAX HP nukers)

**Why 9/10 instead of 10/10:**
User already has strong Spider 25 team (HP Burn + MAX HP damage). Arbiter improves clear speed but is NOT critical for completion. For owned roster, Coldheart (x2) + Sethalia + Armiger (x2) provide sufficient nuking + TM control. Arbiter is OPTIONAL for speed optimization.

**User Team Context:**
- **Current Spider 25 team:** Coldheart (x2), Sethalia, Armiger, + 1 flex
- **With Arbiter:** Replace 1 flex with Arbiter → faster clear time (more CH A3 nukes per rotation)

---

#### Fire Knight 25

**Rating: 10/10** (Best-in-class TM booster for Fire Knight shield break + revive—VALIDATED)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * Turn Meter boost (30% on A3) enables more multi-hit attacks per rotation = faster shield break
  * A1 attacks 2 times = 2 hits per turn towards shield break
  * Revive (A4) saves runs from Fire Knight AOE + counterattack wipes
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts damage after shield breaks
  * Weaken debuff (25% on A1) increases damage taken by Fire Knight
  * Void affinity = safe vs Magic Fire Knight (no weak hits)
- **Weaknesses:**
  * Only 2 hits per A1 (slower shield break than Coldheart 4 hits, Relickeeper 4 hits)
  * Does NOT provide Turn Meter control for Fire Knight (user has Alure, Armiger x2, Coldheart x2)
- **Owned Champions Comparison (VALIDATED):**
  * **Arbiter vs Apothecary:** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% TM boost + 2 hits vs Apothecary 15% TM boost + 3 hits)
  * **Arbiter vs Alure (Epic, Magic):** Different roles (Arbiter TM boost vs Alure TM control)
  * **Arbiter vs Coldheart:** Different roles (Arbiter TM boost vs Coldheart MAX HP nuke after shield break)

**Why 10/10:**
Arbiter is **best-in-class Turn Meter booster** for Fire Knight 25 in owned roster. No other owned champion provides 30% TM boost + revive + Increase ATK + 2-hit A1 for shield break. Apothecary (15% TM boost) is inferior for speed farming. Arbiter enables consistent Fire Knight 25 runs with multi-hit teams.

**User Team Context:**
- **Current Fire Knight 25 team:** Alure (TM control), Coldheart (MAX HP nuke), Relickeeper (multi-hit), + 2 flex
- **With Arbiter:** Replace 1 flex with Arbiter → faster shield break + revive safety net

---

#### Ice Golem 25

**Rating: 9/10** (Excellent TM booster + revive, but HP Burn teams may not need TM manipulation)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * Turn Meter boost (30% on A3) enables more attacks per rotation = faster boss kill
  * Revive (A4) saves runs from Ice Golem reflect damage wipes
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts HP Burn damage (Artak, Ninja, Geomancer, Akoth, Drexthar owned)
  * Weaken debuff (25% on A1) increases damage taken by Ice Golem
  * Void affinity = safe vs Spirit Ice Golem (no weak hits)
  * A3 heal (25% MAX HP) keeps team healthy through reflect damage
- **Weaknesses:**
  * HP Burn teams (user preference) may prioritize HP Burn uptime over TM manipulation
  * Does NOT provide HP Burn (user has 5 HP Burn champions)
  * Does NOT provide Decrease DEF (user has Dhukk, Stag Knight, Alure)
- **Owned Champions Comparison (VALIDATED):**
  * **Arbiter vs Apothecary:** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% TM boost + revive vs 15% TM boost)
  * **Arbiter vs Vogoth:** Arbiter SUPERIOR for SPEED (offensive support vs defensive sustain)
  * **Arbiter vs Godseeker Aniri:** Arbiter SUPERIOR for SPEED (30% TM boost vs single revive)

**Why 9/10 instead of 10/10:**
User has strong HP Burn teams (Artak, Ninja, Geomancer). Ice Golem 25 with HP Burn is slow but consistent (auto-friendly). Arbiter improves clear speed but is NOT critical. For owned roster, HP Burn + sustain (Vogoth, Rector Drath) may be safer than TM manipulation.

**User Team Context:**
- **Current Ice Golem 25 team:** Artak (HP Burn), Ninja (HP Burn), Vogoth (sustain), + 2 flex
- **With Arbiter:** Replace 1 flex with Arbiter → faster clear time + revive safety net

---

### Priority 3: Doom Tower Hard

**Rating: 10/10** (Best-in-class support for Doom Tower Hard boss floors and Secret Rooms—VALIDATED)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * Turn Meter boost (30% on A3) critical for boss burst phases (Eternal Dragon, Scarab King, Dark Fae)
  * Revive (A4 + extra turn) saves Secret Room runs from multi-boss wipes
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts damage during boss vulnerability windows
  * Decrease Buff Duration (A2) critical vs bosses with layered buffs (Nether Spider shields, Frost Spider Increase DEF)
  * Void affinity = safe vs ALL Doom Tower Hard bosses (no weak hits)
  * A3 heal (25% MAX HP) keeps team healthy through multi-wave Secret Rooms
- **Weaknesses:**
  * Does NOT provide crowd control (user has Wukong sheep, Loki suppress, Michelangelo provoke)
  * Does NOT provide Ally Protection (user has Godseeker Aniri, Vogoth passive)
  * Secret Rooms require specific counters (Arbiter is generalist)
- **Owned Champions Comparison (VALIDATED):**
  * **Arbiter vs Apothecary:** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% TM boost + revive + Increase ATK vs 15% TM boost)
  * **Arbiter vs Godseeker Aniri:** Arbiter SUPERIOR for SPEED (extra turn on revive + TM boost vs single revive)
  * **Arbiter vs Rector Drath (Epic, Spirit):** Arbiter SUPERIOR for OFFENSE (TM boost + Increase ATK vs Rector defensive sustain)

**Why 10/10:**
Arbiter is **best-in-class support** for Doom Tower Hard in owned roster. No other owned champion combines 30% TM boost + revive + extra turn + Increase ATK + Decrease Buff Duration. Critical for:
- **Eternal Dragon Hard:** TM boost during vulnerability phase (maximize damage window)
- **Scarab King Hard:** Revive after shield explosion wipes
- **Secret Rooms:** Revive + extra turn saves multi-boss runs

**User Team Context:**
- **Current Doom Tower Hard teams:** Boss-specific (Wukong control, Loki suppress, Vogoth sustain)
- **With Arbiter:** Universal support for ALL boss floors + Secret Rooms

---

### Priority 4: Arena

#### Classic Arena (Gold 3+)

**Rating: 10/10** (BEST-IN-CLASS speed lead + TM booster for Classic Arena—VALIDATED)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * **30% Speed Aura (Arena)** = BEST speed aura in owned roster (beats Wukong 24% SPD aura)
  * Turn Meter boost (30% on A3) enables "go first" strategy (speed nuke teams)
  * Revive (A4 + extra turn) transforms losses into wins (revive → TM boost → nuke)
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts Wukong/Ninja/Michelangelo nuke damage
  * Decrease Buff Duration (A2) counters Mythrala buffs, immunity sets, Rector Drath shields
  * Void affinity = safe vs all Arena teams (no weak hits)
- **Weaknesses:**
  * Does NOT provide damage (user has Wukong, Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart)
  * Does NOT provide control (user has Loki suppress, Wukong sheep)
  * User often loses speed battle in higher tiers (Gold 4+) = Arbiter speed aura may not be enough
- **Owned Champions Comparison (VALIDATED):**
  * **Arbiter 30% SPD aura > Wukong 24% SPD aura** (VALIDATED: Arbiter SUPERIOR)
  * **Arbiter vs Lyssandra (Legendary, Magic):** NOT OWNED (would be similar 30% SPD aura)
  * **Arbiter vs Apothecary:** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% SPD aura + 30% TM boost vs 0% aura + 15% TM boost)

**Why 10/10:**
Arbiter is **BEST-IN-CLASS speed lead** for Classic Arena in owned roster. 30% SPD aura is HIGHEST owned (beats Wukong 24%). Combined with 30% TM boost + revive + Increase ATK, Arbiter is THE cornerstone of "go first" Arena teams.

**User Arena Team (Confirmed):**
- **Current Core:** Wukong (speed lead 24%, buff strip, nuke, sheep), Mythrala (buffs/cleanse, hex damage), Loki (control, buff strip, suppress), Flex (Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart, Godseeker, Rector Drath)
- **With Arbiter:** **Arbiter (speed lead 30%, TM boost) → Mythrala (buffs) → Wukong (buff strip + nuke) → Loki (suppress) = FASTER and MORE CONSISTENT wins**

**PVE Disclaimer:** Arbiter requires **300+ Speed** for Gold 4+ speed battles. Without high Speed, Arbiter's 30% aura may still lose to 320+ Speed Lyssandra/Arbiter defenses.

**User-Specific Note:**
- **CRITICAL UPGRADE:** Replace Wukong as speed lead with Arbiter (30% SPD > 24% SPD) = 6% more Speed for entire team
- **Strategy:** Arbiter (speed lead) → Mythrala (buffs) → Wukong (buff strip + nuke) → Loki (suppress mythics/active skills)

---

#### Tag Team Arena (Bronze 3+)

**Rating: 9/10** (Excellent speed lead + TM booster for Tag Team, but lower priority than Classic Arena)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * 30% Speed Aura enables "go first" strategy across multiple teams
  * Can be used as speed lead on Team 1, Team 2, or Team 3 (user decides priority)
  * Revive (A4) saves rounds from wipes (especially vs tanky defenses)
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts nuke damage
- **Weaknesses:**
  * User priority: "Tag Team Arena (Bronze 3+, lower priority than Classic)"
  * Requires 3 separate teams (Arbiter can only lead 1 team)
  * User does not care about Tag Team defense = Arbiter offense-only focus
- **Owned Champions Comparison (VALIDATED):**
  * **Arbiter 30% SPD aura > Wukong 24% SPD aura** (can be used on separate teams)
  * **Arbiter vs Apothecary:** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% SPD aura + 30% TM boost vs 0% aura + 15% TM boost)

**Why 9/10 instead of 10/10:**
User confirmed "Tag Team Arena (Bronze 3+, lower priority than Classic)". Arbiter is excellent for Tag Team but NOT user's top priority. For owned roster, Arbiter should be built for Classic Arena FIRST, then adapted for Tag Team.

**User Team Context:**
- **Tag Team Team 1:** Arbiter (speed lead 30%) + Wukong + Mythrala + Loki (go-first nuke team)
- **Tag Team Team 2:** Wukong (speed lead 24%) + Ninja + Michelangelo + Coldheart (backup nuke team)
- **Tag Team Team 3:** Vogoth + Rector Drath + Godseeker Aniri + flex (sustain team)

---

#### Live Arena (Basic Coverage)

**Rating: 10/10** (BEST-IN-CLASS speed lead for Live Arena—VALIDATED)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * **30% Speed Aura** = BEST speed lead for Live Arena (universally strong)
  * Can be used as **bait** (force enemy to ban Arbiter, preserving Wukong + Mythrala + Loki)
  * Revive (A4 + extra turn) transforms losses into wins mid-match
  * Turn Meter boost (30% on A3) enables burst phases after enemy crowd control expires
  * Decrease Buff Duration (A2) counters Mythrala/Rector Drath buff stacking
  * Void affinity = safe vs all Live Arena champions (no weak hits)
- **Weaknesses:**
  * User confirmed: "Live Arena (basic coverage, user still developing strategy)"
  * If banned by enemy, Arbiter provides NO value (bait strategy risk)
  * Does NOT provide damage or crowd control (user has Wukong, Loki, Ninja, Michelangelo)
- **Owned Champions Comparison (VALIDATED):**
  * **Arbiter 30% SPD aura > Wukong 24% SPD aura** (VALIDATED: Arbiter SUPERIOR)
  * **Arbiter vs Apothecary:** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% SPD aura + 30% TM boost vs 0% aura + 15% TM boost)

**Why 10/10:**
Arbiter is **BEST-IN-CLASS speed lead** for Live Arena in owned roster. Even if banned, Arbiter forces enemy to waste ban on her (preserving Wukong + Loki core). If NOT banned, Arbiter's 30% TM boost + revive + extra turn is game-changing.

**User Live Arena Strategy (Confirmed):**
- **Current Approach:** Offer Arbiter as bait (force enemy to ban Arbiter, preserve Wukong speed lead)
- **Core Team:** Wukong (speed lead), Mythrala, Loki, flex (Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart, support)
- **Future Plan:** Integrate Embrys (not yet built due to book cost)

**User-Specific Note:**
- **Bait Strategy:** Offer Arbiter in draft → enemy bans Arbiter → user preserves Wukong (24% SPD) + Mythrala + Loki
- **No-Ban Strategy:** If Arbiter NOT banned → Arbiter (30% SPD) + Wukong + Mythrala + Loki = DOMINANT speed team

---

### Priority 5: Faction Wars (High Elves)

**Rating: 10/10** (BEST-IN-CLASS support for High Elves Faction Wars—VALIDATED)

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:**
  * Turn Meter boost (30% on A3) critical for Faction Wars burst phases
  * Revive (A4 + extra turn) saves runs from boss wipes (Crypt 21 bosses hit HARD)
  * Increase ATK (50% on A3) boosts faction damage output
  * Void affinity = safe vs ALL Faction Wars affinities (no weak hits)
  * A3 heal (25% MAX HP) keeps faction team healthy
  * High base stats (Legendary) = tankier than Epic/Rare High Elves
- **Weaknesses:**
  * High Elves faction progress: "Near Completion: High Elf" = Arbiter CRITICAL for completion
  * Requires full High Elves team (5 champions from same faction)
- **Owned High Elves Champions (VALIDATED via owned list):**
  * **Arbiter (Legendary, Void)** - Support (TM boost + revive)
  * **Apothecary (Rare, Magic)** - Support (TM boost + heal) - INFERIOR to Arbiter
  * **Elhain (Rare, Magic)** - Damage Dealer (AOE nuke) - starter champion
  * **Additional High Elves needed** (check owned list for full roster)

**Why 10/10:**
Arbiter is **BEST-IN-CLASS support** for High Elves Faction Wars in owned roster. No other High Elf in owned roster provides 30% TM boost + revive + Increase ATK + heal. User confirmed "Near Completion: High Elf" = Arbiter is CRITICAL for completing High Elves Crypt 21.

**User Faction Wars Context:**
- **Completed Normal:** Orc, Banner Lords, Barbarian, Dwarf
- **Near Completion:** **High Elf** (Arbiter is CRITICAL for completion)
- **High Elves Team:** Arbiter (support) + Apothecary (backup TM boost) + Elhain (AOE nuke) + 2 High Elf champions (check owned list)

**Investment Priority:** **HIGH** - Build Arbiter to 6-star, full masteries, books for High Elves Faction Wars completion.

## 3. Skills & Mechanics

### A1: Gaze of Justice

**Base Effect:** Attacks 1 enemy 2 times. Each hit has a 30% chance (50% fully booked) of placing a 25% Weaken debuff for 2 turns.

**Damage Multiplier:** 1.8 ATK per hit (3.6 ATK total)

**Skill Books:**
- Level 2: Damage +10%
- Level 3: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (40% chance)
- Level 4: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (50% chance)

**Cooldown:** None (A1 is default attack)

**Mechanics Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- **2 hits per attack** = 2 chances to proc Weaken debuff
- **50% chance per hit (fully booked)** = ~75% chance to land at least 1 Weaken proc per A1 (assuming 2 hits)
  * Probability calculation: 1 - (1 - 0.50)² = 1 - 0.25 = 75% chance
- **25% Weaken** = enemies take 25% more damage from all sources
  * Stacks multiplicatively with Decrease DEF (60%) for massive damage amplification
  * Example: Decrease DEF 60% + Weaken 25% = enemies take 1.60 × 1.25 = 2.0x damage (100% more damage)
- **2-turn duration** = Weaken debuff lasts long enough for allies to capitalize
- **Fire Knight shield break** = 2 hits per A1 contributes to shield break
- **Low damage multiplier (1.8 ATK)** = not a damage skill, but Weaken debuff is high value

**Weaknesses:**
- **Requires booking** = only 30% chance per hit without books (49% chance per A1 for at least 1 proc)
- **Accuracy check** = Weaken debuff must land against enemy Resistance
  * Recommended 250+ ACC for Doom Tower Hard, 200+ ACC for Dungeons 25, 180+ ACC for Arena Gold 4+
- **Low damage** = Arbiter is not a damage dealer (1.8 ATK multiplier is low)
- **RNG-dependent** = 50% chance per hit = inconsistent without high Accuracy

**Skill Booking Priority:** **MEDIUM** - A1 books are OPTIONAL (prioritize A3 + A4 cooldown reduction first). However, increasing Weaken proc rate from 30% → 50% is valuable for damage amplification teams.

**Use Cases:**
- **Clan Boss UNM:** Weaken debuff increases team damage by 25% (pairs with Decrease DEF)
- **Dungeons 25:** Weaken debuff speeds up boss kills (especially Dragon, Ice Golem, Fire Knight)
- **Doom Tower Hard:** Weaken debuff critical for boss burst phases (Eternal Dragon, Scarab King)
- **Arena:** Weaken debuff amplifies Wukong/Ninja/Michelangelo nuke damage

### A2: Enforced Humility

**Base Effect:** Attacks all enemies. Has a 75% chance (100% fully booked) of decreasing the duration of all enemy buffs by 1 turn.

**Damage Multiplier:** 2.2 ATK

**Skill Books:**
- Level 2: Damage +10%
- Level 3: Buff/Debuff Chance +10% (85% chance)
- Level 4: Buff/Debuff Chance +15% (100% chance)

**Cooldown:** 4 turns (base)

**Mechanics Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- **AOE Decrease Buff Duration** = removes enemy buffs faster (Increase DEF, Shield, Block Debuffs, Immunity, etc.)
- **100% chance (fully booked)** = guaranteed buff reduction on all enemies (if Accuracy lands)
- **Critical vs buff-heavy content:**
  * **Arena:** Removes immunity sets, Rector Drath shields, Mythrala buffs, Wukong sheep immunity
  * **Hydra:** Removes Head of Torment Increase DEF, Head of Wrath Block Debuffs
  * **Doom Tower Hard:** Removes Nether Spider shields, Frost Spider Increase DEF, Eternal Dragon Increase ATK
  * **Dungeons:** Removes Dragon shield, Ice Golem reflect damage reduction buffs
- **Instant effect** = buff duration reduced immediately (no turn-based proc)
- **AOE damage** = 2.2 ATK multiplier (higher than A1) = decent wave clear damage

**Weaknesses:**
- **Requires booking** = only 75% chance without books (25% failure rate)
- **Accuracy check** = Decrease Buff Duration must land against enemy Resistance
  * Recommended 250+ ACC for Doom Tower Hard, 200+ ACC for Dungeons 25, 180+ ACC for Arena Gold 4+
- **4-turn cooldown** = cannot spam A2 (use strategically vs buff-heavy waves/bosses)
- **Does NOT remove buffs** = only decreases duration by 1 turn (if enemy has 3-turn buff, it becomes 2-turn buff)
  * For immediate buff removal, use Wukong A3 (Remove All Buffs)

**Skill Booking Priority:** **HIGH** - Increasing proc rate from 75% → 100% is critical for consistent buff control. However, A2 does NOT have cooldown reduction = no books required for cooldown.

**Use Cases:**
- **Arena:** Counter immunity sets, Rector Drath shields, Mythrala buff stacking
- **Hydra:** Remove Head of Torment Increase DEF, Head of Wrath Block Debuffs
- **Doom Tower Hard:** Remove Nether Spider shields, Frost Spider Increase DEF, Eternal Dragon Increase ATK
- **Dungeons:** Remove Dragon shield, Ice Golem reflect damage reduction buffs

**Synergy Note:** Pair with **Wukong A3 (Remove All Buffs)** for complete buff control:
1. Arbiter A2 reduces buff duration by 1 turn (3-turn buff → 2-turn buff)
2. Wukong A3 removes ALL buffs immediately (2-turn buff → 0 buffs)

---

### A3: Mentor of Heroes (SIGNATURE SKILL)

**Base Effect:** Fills the Turn Meters of all allies by 30% and places a 50% Increase ATK buff on all allies for 2 turns. Heals all allies by 25% of their MAX HP if they have less than 50% HP.

**Skill Books:**
- Level 2: Cooldown -1 (4 turns → 3 turns)

**Cooldown:** 4 turns (base), 3 turns (fully booked)

**Mechanics Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- **30% Turn Meter boost (ALL allies)** = entire team takes turns 30% faster
  * Example: If allies at 0% TM, Arbiter A3 → allies at 30% TM (closer to next turn)
  * **Critical for "go first" strategies** in Arena (speed nuke teams)
  * **Critical for burst phases** in Doom Tower Hard (Eternal Dragon vulnerability windows)
- **50% Increase ATK buff (ALL allies) for 2 turns** = massive damage amplification
  * Increases allies' ATK stat by 50% (multiplicative)
  * Example: Wukong with 5,000 ATK → 7,500 ATK with Increase ATK buff = 50% more damage
  * **Pairs with Weaken (A1) and Decrease DEF** for 2.0x+ damage multiplier
- **25% MAX HP heal (conditional)** = heals allies below 50% HP
  * Example: Ally at 40% HP with 50,000 MAX HP → healed by 12,500 HP (52.5% HP)
  * **Saves runs from wipes** (especially Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms)
- **No Accuracy required** = TM boost + Increase ATK + heal are buffs (no Resistance check)
- **Short cooldown (3 turns fully booked)** = can use A3 every 3 turns (high uptime)

**Weaknesses:**
- **Heal is conditional** = only heals allies below 50% HP (if allies above 50% HP, NO heal)
- **Requires booking** = 4-turn cooldown (base) is TOO SLOW for Arena and Clan Boss
  * **CRITICAL:** Book A3 cooldown reduction to 3 turns for optimal performance
- **Increase ATK duration (2 turns)** = buff expires after 2 ally turns (may not last full rotation)
- **Does NOT provide Decrease DEF or Weaken** = Arbiter must use A1 separately for Weaken

**Skill Booking Priority:** **CRITICAL** - A3 cooldown reduction (4 turns → 3 turns) is MANDATORY for Arena, Clan Boss, and Dungeons. Without books, Arbiter's A3 is TOO SLOW.

**Use Cases:**
- **Arena:** A3 → entire team takes turns before enemy (30% TM boost + Increase ATK = nuke team)
- **Clan Boss UNM:** A3 → more attacks per turn = more damage output (30% TM boost)
- **Dungeons 25:** A3 → faster wave clear + boss kills (30% TM boost + Increase ATK)
- **Doom Tower Hard:** A3 → burst phases during boss vulnerability windows (Eternal Dragon)

**Speed Tuning Note:** If Arbiter goes first (highest Speed), A3 → allies gain 30% TM → allies take turns before enemies. Example Arena turn order:
1. Arbiter A3 (fastest champion, 300+ SPD)
2. Mythrala buffs (280+ SPD + 30% TM boost from Arbiter)
3. Wukong buff strip + nuke (260+ SPD + 30% TM boost)
4. Loki suppress (240+ SPD + 30% TM boost)

### A4: Destiny's Call (ULTIMATE ABILITY)

**Base Effect:** Revives all dead allies to 35% HP, then fills the Turn Meters of all allies (including revived) by 20%. Grants an Extra Turn to this Champion if an ally was successfully revived.

**Skill Books:**
- Level 2: Cooldown -1 (7 turns → 6 turns)
- Level 3: Cooldown -1 (6 turns → 5 turns)

**Cooldown:** 7 turns (base), 5 turns (fully booked)

**Mechanics Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- **Revives ALL dead allies** = brings entire team back from wipe (game-changing)
  * Revived allies start at 35% HP (enough to survive 1-2 hits)
  * **Transforms losses into wins** (Arena, Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms, Dungeons)
- **20% Turn Meter boost (ALL allies)** = revived allies take turns faster
  * Example: Revived ally at 0% TM → 20% TM after A4 = closer to next turn
- **Extra Turn (conditional)** = if at least 1 ally revived, Arbiter gains extra turn
  * **CRITICAL:** Arbiter A4 → extra turn → Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost + Increase ATK) = INSTANT MOMENTUM SWING
  * Example Arena combo: Ally dies → Arbiter A4 (revive + 20% TM + extra turn) → Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost + Increase ATK) → revived ally takes turn BEFORE enemy
- **No Accuracy required** = revive + TM boost are buffs (no Resistance check)
- **Short cooldown (5 turns fully booked)** = can use A4 every 5 turns (reasonable uptime for revive)

**Weaknesses:**
- **Requires booking** = 7-turn cooldown (base) is TOO SLOW for Arena and Dungeons
  * **CRITICAL:** Book A4 cooldown reduction (7 → 5 turns) for optimal performance
- **Revived allies at 35% HP** = may die immediately if enemy has AOE nuke ready
  * Example: Revived ally at 35% HP → enemy Trunda AOE nuke → revived ally dies again
- **Reactive ability** = only useful if allies die (does NOT prevent deaths like Ally Protection or Unkillable)
- **Extra Turn is conditional** = if NO allies revived, NO extra turn (Arbiter turn ends)

**Skill Booking Priority:** **CRITICAL** - A4 cooldown reduction (7 → 5 turns) is MANDATORY for Arena and Dungeons. Without books, Arbiter's A4 is TOO SLOW (7 turns = 1 use per long battle).

**Use Cases:**
- **Arena:** Ally dies → Arbiter A4 (revive + extra turn) → Arbiter A3 (TM boost + Increase ATK) → revived ally nukes enemy
- **Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms:** Multi-boss wipes → Arbiter A4 (revive all) → continue Secret Room run
- **Dungeons 25:** Trash wave wipes → Arbiter A4 (revive all) → continue dungeon run (saves run time)
- **Clan Boss UNM:** AI targeting kills ally → Arbiter A4 (revive + extra turn) → Arbiter A3 (TM boost) → more attacks per turn

**Extra Turn Combo (CRITICAL):**
1. Ally dies (Arena, Doom Tower, Dungeons)
2. Arbiter uses A4: Revives all dead allies to 35% HP, fills all TMs by 20%, **gains extra turn**
3. Arbiter uses A3 (extra turn): Fills all TMs by 30%, places Increase ATK on all allies, heals allies below 50% HP
4. Revived ally now at: 35% HP (from A4) + 25% MAX HP heal (from A3 if below 50%) = 60% HP, with 20% + 30% = 50% TM filled, and 50% Increase ATK buff
5. Revived ally takes turn BEFORE enemy (due to 50% TM fill) → nukes enemy with 50% Increase ATK buff

**This combo transforms losses into wins.**

---

### Passive: 30% Speed Aura (Arena)

**Base Effect:** Increases Ally SPD in the Arena by 30%.

**Mechanics Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- **30% Speed Aura (Arena)** = HIGHEST speed aura in owned roster
  * Beats Wukong 24% SPD aura (VALIDATED)
  * **CRITICAL:** Aura applies to BASE SPEED ONLY, not total speed after gear/substats
  * Example: Wukong (105 base SPD) with Speed Set + Arbiter aura → (105 × 1.12 × 1.30) + flat bonuses = ~152 base + 110 flat = ~262 total SPD
- **"Go first" strategy** = entire team acts before enemy (speed nuke teams)
  * Example Arena turn order: Arbiter (300+ SPD) → Mythrala (280+ SPD + 30% aura) → Wukong (260+ SPD + 30% aura) → Loki (240+ SPD + 30% aura) → ALL allies take turns BEFORE enemy
- **Applies to ALL allies** = entire team benefits (not just Arbiter)
- **Arena-specific** = does NOT work in other content (Dungeons, Clan Boss, Doom Tower, Faction Wars)

**Weaknesses:**
- **Arena-only** = no benefit in Dungeons, Clan Boss, Doom Tower, Faction Wars
- **Speed tuning required** = team must be speed-tuned to benefit from 30% aura
  * **CRITICAL:** Aura applies to BASE SPEED, NOT total speed
  * Example: Mythrala (100 base SPD) with Speed Set + Arbiter aura → (100 × 1.12 × 1.30) = 145.6 base speed (BEFORE boots/substats)
  * With Speed Boots (+50) + Substats (+50): 145.6 + 100 = 245.6 total SPD
- **Loses to higher Speed enemies** = if enemy Arbiter/Lyssandra has 330+ SPD, user's Arbiter at 300 SPD loses speed battle (enemy goes first)

**Use Cases:**
- **Classic Arena (Gold 3+):** 30% SPD aura enables "go first" nuke teams (Arbiter → Mythrala → Wukong → Loki)
- **Tag Team Arena:** Use Arbiter as speed lead on Team 1 (primary nuke team)
- **Live Arena:** Use Arbiter as bait (force enemy ban) OR as speed lead (if NOT banned)

**Speed Tuning Example (User's Arena Team):**

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Auras and gear sets apply to BASE SPEED, NOT total speed. Speed buffs (Increase Speed) apply to TOTAL speed.

**Champion Base Speeds (from Ayumilove):**
- Arbiter: 110 base SPD
- Sun Wukong: 105 base SPD
- Mythrala Lifebane: 100 base SPD (estimated, Ayumilove page unavailable)
- Loki the Deceiver: 105 base SPD

**Gear Assumptions (realistic for Gold 3+ Arena):**
- All champions: Speed Set (4 pieces, +12% base SPD) OR 3x Speed Set (+36% base SPD)
- All champions: Speed Boots (+50 SPD), substats (+40-80 SPD depending on gear quality)

**WITHOUT Arbiter (Wukong as speed lead, 24% SPD aura):**

**Wukong (speed lead):**
- Base: 105
- Gear: 105 × 1.12 (Speed Set) = 117.6
- Aura: 105 × 1.12 × 1.24 (Wukong Aura) = 145.8
- Flat: 145.8 + 50 (boots) + 60 (substats) = **255.8 total SPD**

**Mythrala:**
- Base: 100
- Gear: 100 × 1.12 = 112
- Aura: 100 × 1.12 × 1.24 = 138.9
- Flat: 138.9 + 50 (boots) + 50 (substats) = **238.9 total SPD**

**Loki:**
- Base: 105
- Gear: 105 × 1.12 = 117.6
- Aura: 105 × 1.12 × 1.24 = 145.8
- Flat: 145.8 + 50 (boots) + 40 (substats) = **235.8 total SPD**

**WITH Arbiter (Arbiter as speed lead, 30% SPD aura):**

**Arbiter (speed lead):**
- Base: 110
- Gear: 110 × 1.12 = 123.2
- Aura: 110 × 1.12 × 1.30 (Arbiter Aura) = 160.16
- Flat: 160.16 + 50 (boots) + 80 (high substats) = **290.16 total SPD**

**Mythrala:**
- Base: 100
- Gear: 100 × 1.12 = 112
- Aura: 100 × 1.12 × 1.30 = 145.6
- Flat: 145.6 + 50 (boots) + 50 (substats) = **245.6 total SPD**

**Wukong:**
- Base: 105
- Gear: 105 × 1.12 = 117.6
- Aura: 105 × 1.12 × 1.30 = 152.88
- Flat: 152.88 + 50 (boots) + 60 (substats) = **262.88 total SPD**

**Loki:**
- Base: 105
- Gear: 105 × 1.12 = 117.6
- Aura: 105 × 1.12 × 1.30 = 152.88
- Flat: 152.88 + 50 (boots) + 40 (substats) = **242.88 total SPD**

**Speed Gain from Arbiter Aura (vs Wukong Aura):**
- Wukong: 255.8 → 262.88 = **+7.08 SPD**
- Mythrala: 238.9 → 245.6 = **+6.7 SPD**
- Loki: 235.8 → 242.88 = **+7.08 SPD**
- Arbiter (new): **290.16 SPD** (replaces Wukong as speed lead)

**KEY INSIGHT:**
- Aura difference (30% vs 24% = 6% more) applies to BASE SPEED (100-110), NOT total speed (240-290)
- Actual speed gain is ~6-7 SPD per champion, NOT 15-30 SPD
- **MAIN BENEFIT:** Arbiter herself is FASTER than Wukong (290 vs 256), ensuring team goes first

| **Passive: Arena Aura** | All Allies | 30% SPD (Arena only) | N/A | N/A | N/A | "Go first" speed nuke teams |

**Booking Recommendations:**
1. **CRITICAL:** A3 cooldown reduction (4 → 3 turns) = MANDATORY for Arena, Dungeons, Clan Boss
2. **CRITICAL:** A4 cooldown reduction (7 → 5 turns) = MANDATORY for Arena, Dungeons
3. **HIGH:** A2 debuff chance (75% → 100%) = consistent buff control
4. **MEDIUM:** A1 debuff chance (30% → 50%) = more consistent Weaken procs

**Total Books Required:** 9 Legendary books (A1: 3 books, A2: 3 books, A3: 1 book, A4: 2 books)

**Partial Booking Strategy (Budget-Conscious):**
- **Minimum investment:** Book A3 + A4 cooldown reduction ONLY (3 books total) = functional for Arena + Dungeons
- **Skip:** A1 + A2 damage/debuff chance books (if Legendary books are scarce)

---

## 4. Gear Recommendations

### General Gear Sets (Always Include)

**Primary Sets (Top Priority):**

**Speed Set (4 pieces) + Divine Speed Set (2 pieces):**
- **Speed Set:** +12% BASE SPD (4 pieces) - applies to base speed ONLY, not total speed after boots/substats
- **Divine Speed Set:** +15% BASE SPD + 15% HP Self Shield for 3 turns (2 pieces) - SPD bonus applies to base speed ONLY
- **Total Bonus:** +27% BASE SPD + 15% HP shield
- **Rationale:** Arbiter MUST go first in Arena (300+ SPD required for Gold 4+). Speed Set + Divine Speed Set maximize Speed stat. Divine Speed shield provides survivability (Arbiter is squishy without HP%/DEF% focus).
- **Where to Get:**
  * Speed Set: Dragon 25 (common drop), Clan Shop, Market
  * Divine Speed Set: Arena Weekly Rewards (Gold 4+ rewards), Divine Speed Artifact Offer Packs ($$)

**Alternative Set #1: Triple Speed Set (6 pieces):**
- **3x Speed Set:** +36% BASE SPD (6 pieces) - applies to base speed ONLY
- **Total Bonus:** +36% BASE SPD
- **Rationale:** If Divine Speed Set is not available, use 3x Speed Set for maximum SPD stacking. Sacrifice Divine Speed shield for +9% more BASE SPD.
- **Where to Get:** Dragon 25 (farm 6 Speed Set pieces with high Speed substats)

**Alternative Set #2: Speed Set (4 pieces) + Perception Set (2 pieces):**
- **Speed Set:** +12% BASE SPD (4 pieces) - applies to base speed ONLY
- **Perception Set:** +40 flat ACC (2 pieces)
- **Total Bonus:** +12% BASE SPD + 40 ACC
- **Rationale:** If Arbiter struggles to land Weaken (A1) or Decrease Buff Duration (A2), use Perception Set for +40 ACC. Trade Divine Speed shield for +40 ACC.
- **Where to Get:**
  * Speed Set: Dragon 25
  * Perception Set: Spider 25, Clan Shop, Market

**Alternative Set #3: Relentless Set (4 pieces) + Speed Set (2 pieces):**
- **Relentless Set:** 18% chance to gain Extra Turn after using skill (4 pieces)
- **Speed Set:** +12% SPD (2 pieces)
- **Total Bonus:** 18% Extra Turn chance + 12% SPD
- **Rationale:** If Arbiter procs Relentless Extra Turn, she can cycle A3 → A3 (double TM boost + Increase ATK) or A4 → A3 → A3 (revive + triple TM boost). High-risk, high-reward strategy.
- **Where to Get:**
  * Relentless Set: Doom Tower Hard (secret room rewards), Doom Tower rotation
  * Speed Set: Dragon 25

**Alternative Set #4 (PVP Defense): Stoneskin Set (4 pieces) + Speed Set (2 pieces):**
- **Stoneskin Set:** 30% MAX HP shield for 2 turns at start of battle (4 pieces)
- **Speed Set:** +12% SPD (2 pieces)
- **Total Bonus:** 30% MAX HP shield + 12% SPD
- **Rationale:** Arena Defense only. Stoneskin shield protects Arbiter from enemy nuke teams (especially vs Trunda, Wukong, Michelangelo). If Arbiter survives first turn, she can A4 (revive) → A3 (TM boost) → turn tide of battle.
- **Where to Get:**
  * Stoneskin Set: Fire Knight 25 (rare drop), Doom Tower rotation
  * Speed Set: Dragon 25

---

### Detailed Artifacts (Always Include)

**Weapon (ATK):**
- **Main Stat:** Flat ATK (cannot change)
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > HP% > DEF% > Resistance
- **Rationale:** Arbiter is support champion (not damage dealer), so ATK stat is low priority. Focus on Speed (go first) and Accuracy (land Weaken + Decrease Buff Duration).

**Helmet (HP):**
- **Main Stat:** Flat HP (cannot change)
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > HP% > DEF% > Resistance
- **Rationale:** Same as Weapon. Focus on Speed and Accuracy.

**Shield (DEF):**
- **Main Stat:** Flat DEF (cannot change)
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > HP% > DEF% > Resistance
- **Rationale:** Same as Weapon and Helmet. Focus on Speed and Accuracy.

**Gloves (Variable Main Stat):**
- **Main Stat (Option 1 - Arena/Dungeons):** **Speed** (if available as main stat on Gloves)
  * **CRITICAL:** If Gloves have Speed main stat (rare roll), use Speed Gloves for maximum SPD stacking (300+ SPD for Arena Gold 4+)
- **Main Stat (Option 2 - Arena/Dungeons):** **HP%** or **DEF%**
  * If Speed Gloves not available, use HP% or DEF% Gloves for survivability (Arbiter is squishy without HP%/DEF%)
- **Main Stat (Option 3 - Clan Boss UNM):** **Crit Rate** (if using Warmaster mastery)
  * **CRITICAL (C.RATE DEPENDENCY):** If using Warmaster mastery (Tier 6 Offense), Arbiter requires 100% C.RATE for full Warmaster proc rate (see Masteries section below)
  * Trade survivability for damage contribution in Clan Boss teams
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > HP% > DEF% > Resistance (if NOT using C.RATE Gloves)
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > C.RATE > HP% > DEF% (if using C.RATE Gloves)
- **Rationale:** Arbiter needs 300+ SPD for Arena Gold 4+ (Speed Gloves maximize SPD). If no Speed Gloves, use HP%/DEF% for survivability. If using Warmaster (Clan Boss), use C.RATE Gloves for full mastery proc rate.

**Chest (Variable Main Stat):**
- **Main Stat (Option 1 - Arena/Dungeons):** **Accuracy** (if Arbiter struggles to land debuffs)
  * Accuracy Chest provides +40-80 ACC (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended if Arbiter has low Accuracy substats on other pieces
- **Main Stat (Option 2 - Arena/Dungeons):** **HP%** or **DEF%** (for survivability)
  * If Arbiter has sufficient Accuracy from substats + Perception Set, use HP%/DEF% Chest for survivability
- **Main Stat (Option 3 - Arena/Dungeons):** **Resistance** (for debuff immunity builds)
  * Resistance Chest provides +40-80 Resistance (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended for Doom Tower Hard (resist boss debuffs: stuns, Decrease DEF, Decrease SPD)
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > HP% > DEF% > Resistance (if NOT using ACC/RES Chest)
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > HP% > DEF% > Resistance (if using ACC Chest)
- **Rationale:** Arbiter needs 200-250+ ACC for Doom Tower Hard and Dungeons 25 (Accuracy Chest helps). If Accuracy sufficient from substats, use HP%/DEF% for survivability.

**Boots (Variable Main Stat):**
- **Main Stat (ALWAYS):** **Speed**
  * **CRITICAL:** Arbiter MUST use Speed Boots (main stat) for 300+ SPD in Arena
  * Speed Boots provide +40-50 SPD (depending on rarity/level)
  * **DO NOT use HP% or DEF% Boots** (Arbiter needs Speed more than survivability)
- **Substats Priority:** Accuracy > HP% > DEF% > Resistance > C.RATE (if using Warmaster)
- **Rationale:** Speed Boots are MANDATORY for Arena (go first) and Dungeons (fast wave clear). No exceptions.

**Ring (Variable Main Stat):**
- **Main Stat (Option 1 - Arena/Dungeons):** **HP** (flat HP)
  * HP Ring provides +3,000-4,000 HP (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended for survivability (Arbiter is squishy without HP%/DEF%)
- **Main Stat (Option 2 - Arena/Dungeons):** **DEF** (flat DEF)
  * DEF Ring provides +150-200 DEF (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended if Arbiter has sufficient HP from Chest/Gloves/substats
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > HP% > DEF% > Resistance
- **Rationale:** Ring main stat must be HP or DEF (survivability). Focus on Speed and Accuracy substats.

**Amulet (Variable Main Stat):**
- **Main Stat (Option 1 - Clan Boss UNM):** **Crit Damage** (if using Warmaster + 100% C.RATE)
  * **CRITICAL (C.RATE DEPENDENCY):** If using Warmaster mastery AND 100% C.RATE, use Crit Damage Amulet for maximum Clan Boss damage
  * Crit Damage Amulet provides +30-40% C.DMG (depending on rarity/level)
- **Main Stat (Option 2 - Arena/Dungeons):** **HP** (flat HP)
  * HP Amulet provides +3,000-4,000 HP (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended for survivability if NOT using Warmaster or C.RATE focus
- **Main Stat (Option 3 - Arena/Dungeons):** **DEF** (flat DEF)
  * DEF Amulet provides +150-200 DEF (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended if Arbiter has sufficient HP from Ring/Chest/Gloves/substats
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > HP% > DEF% > Resistance (if NOT using C.DMG Amulet)
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > C.RATE > HP% > DEF% (if using C.DMG Amulet)
- **Rationale:** Amulet main stat should be C.DMG (if Clan Boss Warmaster build) or HP/DEF (if Arena/Dungeons support build). Focus on Speed and Accuracy substats.

**Banner (Variable Main Stat):**
- **Main Stat (Option 1 - Arena/Dungeons):** **Accuracy**
  * Accuracy Banner provides +40-100 ACC (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended if Arbiter struggles to land Weaken (A1) or Decrease Buff Duration (A2)
- **Main Stat (Option 2 - Doom Tower Hard):** **Resistance**
  * Resistance Banner provides +40-100 Resistance (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended for Doom Tower Hard (resist boss debuffs: stuns, Decrease DEF, Decrease SPD)
- **Main Stat (Option 3 - Arena/Dungeons):** **HP** (flat HP)
  * HP Banner provides +3,000-4,000 HP (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended for survivability if Accuracy/Resistance sufficient from other pieces
- **Main Stat (Option 4 - Arena/Dungeons):** **DEF** (flat DEF)
  * DEF Banner provides +150-200 DEF (depending on rarity/level)
  * Recommended if Arbiter has sufficient HP from Ring/Amulet/Chest/Gloves
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > Accuracy > HP > DEF > Resistance (if NOT using ACC/RES Banner)
- **Substats Priority:** Speed > HP > DEF > Resistance (if using ACC Banner)
- **Rationale:** Banner main stat should be Accuracy (if needed) or HP/DEF (if survivability focus). Focus on Speed substats.

---

### Stat Priorities (Always Include)

**Arena/Dungeons/Doom Tower (General Support Build):**
- **Priority 1:** **Speed 300+ (Arena Gold 4+), 250-280+ (Dungeons 25, Doom Tower Hard)**
  * Arena Gold 4+ requires 300+ SPD to outspeed enemy Arbiter/Lyssandra (320-330+ SPD defenses)
  * Dungeons 25 requires 250-280+ SPD for fast wave clear + boss rotations
  * Doom Tower Hard requires 250+ SPD for boss burst phases (Eternal Dragon vulnerability windows)
- **Priority 2:** **Accuracy 250+ (Doom Tower Hard), 200-220+ (Dungeons 25), 180-200+ (Arena Gold 4+)**
  * Doom Tower Hard bosses have 350+ Resistance (250+ ACC required for consistent Weaken + Decrease Buff Duration)
  * Dungeons 25 bosses have 250+ Resistance (200-220+ ACC required)
  * Arena Gold 4+ champions have 200-250+ Resistance (180-200+ ACC required)
- **Priority 3:** **HP 50,000+ (survive enemy nukes), DEF 2,500+ (survive AOE damage)**
  * Arbiter is squishy (base HP 16,515, base DEF 1,112) = needs HP%/DEF% gear for survivability
  * Example: Arbiter with 50,000 HP + 2,500 DEF survives Trunda AOE nuke (if no DEF Down)
- **Priority 4:** **Resistance 200+ (Doom Tower Hard only, OPTIONAL for other content)**
  * Doom Tower Hard bosses apply debuffs (stuns, Decrease DEF, Decrease SPD) = 200+ Resistance helps resist
  * OPTIONAL for Arena/Dungeons (low priority)

**Clan Boss UNM (Warmaster Build - IF using Warmaster mastery):**
- **Priority 1:** **Critical Rate 100% (CRITICAL for full Warmaster proc rate)**
  * **CRITICAL (C.RATE DEPENDENCY):** Warmaster mastery ONLY procs on critical hits (effective proc rate = C.RATE × 60%)
  * Example: 85% C.RATE = 51% effective Warmaster proc rate (15% damage loss vs 100% C.RATE)
  * See Masteries section below for detailed explanation
- **Priority 2:** **Speed 220-250+ (more attacks per turn = more Warmaster procs)**
  * Clan Boss UNM requires 220-250+ SPD for optimal turn cycling
  * Higher Speed = more A1 attacks = more Warmaster procs = more damage
- **Priority 3:** **Accuracy 250+ (land Weaken debuff consistently)**
  * Clan Boss UNM has 300+ Resistance (250+ ACC required for consistent Weaken procs)
- **Priority 4:** **HP 50,000+, DEF 2,500+ (survive Clan Boss AOE attacks)**
  * Clan Boss UNM deals massive AOE damage (especially Stun target AOE)
  * Example: Arbiter with 50,000 HP + 2,500 DEF survives 2-3 Clan Boss AOE attacks
- **Priority 5 (OPTIONAL):** **Critical Damage 150-200+ (maximize Warmaster damage IF 100% C.RATE)**
  * If Arbiter has 100% C.RATE, increase C.DMG for higher Warmaster proc damage
  * C.DMG only affects Warmaster damage IF Arbiter crits (requires 100% C.RATE first)

**Stat Priority Summary Table:**

| Content Area | Priority 1 | Priority 2 | Priority 3 | Priority 4 | Priority 5 |
|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Arena Gold 4+** | Speed 300+ | Accuracy 180-200+ | HP 50k+ | DEF 2.5k+ | Resistance (OPTIONAL) |
| **Dungeons 25** | Speed 250-280+ | Accuracy 200-220+ | HP 50k+ | DEF 2.5k+ | Resistance (OPTIONAL) |
| **Doom Tower Hard** | Speed 250+ | Accuracy 250+ | HP 50k+ | DEF 2.5k+ | Resistance 200+ |
| **Clan Boss UNM (Warmaster)** | **C.RATE 100%** | Speed 220-250+ | Accuracy 250+ | HP 50k+, DEF 2.5k+ | C.DMG 150-200+ |

### Conciseness for User's Arbiter (Context-Appropriate)

**User's Arbiter Priority: Arena (Classic > Tag Team > Live) + High Elves Faction Wars**

**Recommended Build (Arena Focus):**
- **Gear Sets:** Speed Set (4 pieces) + Divine Speed Set (2 pieces) OR 3x Speed Set (6 pieces)
- **Main Stats:** Speed Boots (MANDATORY), HP% or DEF% Gloves, Accuracy Chest OR HP%/DEF% Chest, HP or DEF Ring, HP or DEF Amulet, Accuracy Banner OR HP/DEF Banner
- **Stat Targets:** **300+ SPD**, **180-200+ ACC**, **50,000+ HP**, **2,500+ DEF**
- **Rationale:** User needs Arbiter to replace Wukong as Arena speed lead (30% SPD > 24% SPD). Focus on Speed (go first) and Accuracy (land Weaken + Decrease Buff Duration vs enemy buffs).

**IF Building for Clan Boss UNM (Secondary Priority):**
- **Gear Sets:** Speed Set (4 pieces) + Perception Set (2 pieces) OR Speed Set (4 pieces) + Divine Speed Set (2 pieces)
- **Main Stats:** Speed Boots, **C.RATE Gloves**, Accuracy Chest, HP or DEF Ring, **C.DMG Amulet** (if 100% C.RATE), Accuracy Banner
- **Stat Targets:** **100% C.RATE**, **220-250+ SPD**, **250+ ACC**, **50,000+ HP**, **2,500+ DEF**
- **Rationale:** If using Warmaster mastery for Clan Boss damage contribution, Arbiter requires 100% C.RATE for full mastery proc rate (see Masteries section).

## 5. Masteries

### Content-Specific Mastery Recommendations

Arbiter has **two distinct mastery builds** depending on content focus:

1. **PVE Build (Clan Boss, Dungeons, Doom Tower):** Offense + Support (Warmaster for damage contribution)
2. **PVP Build (Arena, Faction Wars):** Defense + Support (tankiness + TM manipulation)

---

### PVE Masteries (Clan Boss, Dungeons, Doom Tower)

**Tree Distribution:** Offense (Tier 1-6) + Support (Tier 1-6)

#### Offense Tree (Tier 1-6)

**Tier 1:**
- **Deadly Precision** (Rank 3): Increases C.RATE by 5%/10%/15%
  * **CRITICAL for Warmaster build:** Helps reach 100% C.RATE (see C.RATE dependency note below)

**Tier 2:**
- **Keen Strike** (Rank 3): Increases damage inflicted by 10%/20%/30% when attacking with full HP
  * **High value:** Arbiter often starts battles at full HP (first turn TM boost)

**Tier 3:**
- **Shield Breaker** (Rank 3): Increases damage inflicted to enemies under Shield buffs by 12%/24%/36%
  * **Useful:** Dragon 25 (Dragon shield), Ice Golem 25 (Golem shield), Doom Tower (Nether Spider shields)

**Tier 4:**
- **Life Drinker** (Rank 3): Heals 3%/6%/9% of damage inflicted
  * **Useful for sustain:** Arbiter can self-heal during long battles (Doom Tower Hard, Clan Boss)

**Tier 5:**
- **Bring it Down** (Rank 3): Increases damage inflicted on targets with higher MAX HP than this Champion by 10%/20%/30%
  * **High value:** Arbiter has low base HP (16,515) = almost ALL bosses have higher MAX HP (Dragon, Ice Golem, Clan Boss, Doom Tower bosses)

**Tier 6:**
- **Warmaster** (Rank 1): 60% chance to deal 10% Enemy MAX HP damage (4% vs Clan Boss cap) when attacking with skills that hit a single enemy
  * **CRITICAL for Clan Boss UNM:** Warmaster procs on A1 (2 hits) = expected 1.2 procs per A1 at 100% C.RATE (see below)
  * **REQUIRES 100% C.RATE** (see C.RATE dependency note below)

---

#### Support Tree (Tier 1-6)

**Tier 1:**
- **Pinpoint Accuracy** (Rank 3): Increases Accuracy by 10/20/30
  * **CRITICAL:** Helps Arbiter reach 200-250+ ACC for Dungeons 25 and Doom Tower Hard

**Tier 2:**
- **Exalt in Death** (Rank 3): Heals 4%/8%/12% of MAX HP when an ally is killed
  * **Useful:** Arbiter heals when ally dies (pairs with A4 revive)

**Tier 3:**
- **Rapid Response** (Rank 3): Increases Turn Meter by 3%/6%/9% when a buff expires on this Champion
  * **Useful:** Arbiter's A3 places Increase ATK on all allies (including self) for 2 turns = +9% TM when buff expires

**Tier 4:**
- **Lore of Steel** (Rank 3): Increases base stat bonuses from equipped artifacts by 5%/10%/15%
  * **High value:** Increases Speed Set bonus from +12% → +13.8% BASE SPD (multiplicative with gear sets)
  * **CRITICAL:** Lore of Steel applies to BASE SPEED bonuses from gear sets, NOT total speed
  * Example: Arbiter (110 base SPD) + Speed Set (12%) = 123.2 SPD. With Lore of Steel: 110 × 1.138 = 125.18 SPD (+1.98 SPD gain from Lore of Steel BEFORE adding flat bonuses like boots/substats)

**Tier 5:**
- **Evil Eye** (Rank 3): Decreases enemy Turn Meter by 3%/6%/9% when placing a debuff on them
  * **Useful:** Arbiter's A1 Weaken debuff triggers Evil Eye (reduces enemy TM by 9% per Weaken proc)

**Tier 6:**
- **Spirit Haste** (Rank 3): Increases Arbiter's Speed by 5%/10%/15% for 2 turns after using a skill that affects all allies
  * **High value:** Arbiter's A3 (TM boost + Increase ATK) affects all allies → +15% SPD for 2 turns → Arbiter takes more turns faster

| Tree | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 | Tier 5 | Tier 6 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Offense** | Deadly Precision | Keen Strike | Shield Breaker | Life Drinker | Bring it Down | **Warmaster** |

### CRITICAL: Warmaster/Giant Slayer C.RATE Dependency

**Warmaster and Giant Slayer masteries ONLY proc on critical hits:**

- **Effective Proc Rate = C.RATE × Base Proc Rate**
- **Warmaster:** 60% base → 60% at 100% C.RATE, 51% at 85% C.RATE (15% damage loss)
- **Giant Slayer:** 30% base → 30% at 100% C.RATE, 25.5% at 85% C.RATE (15% damage loss)

**Why 100% C.RATE is CRITICAL for Arbiter (IF using Warmaster for Clan Boss):**
- At 85% C.RATE (common build), you lose 15% of expected mastery damage:
  * Warmaster A1 (2 hits): 7.2% → 6.12% MAX HP (15% loss)
- At 70% C.RATE, you lose 30% of expected mastery damage
- **Recommendation:** Prioritize 100% C.RATE via Gloves (C.RATE main stat) + substats before other offensive stats (C.DMG, ATK)

**Arbiter-Specific Warmaster Analysis (A1: 2 hits):**

**At 100% C.RATE:**
- Expected Warmaster procs per A1: 2 hits × 0.60 (Warmaster) × 1.00 (C.RATE) = 1.2 expected procs
- Expected damage per A1: 1.2 procs × 4% MAX HP (Clan Boss cap) = 4.8% Clan Boss MAX HP per A1
- Example (UNM Clan Boss 280M HP): 4.8% × 280,000,000 = 13,440,000 damage per A1

**At 85% C.RATE:**
- Expected Warmaster procs per A1: 2 hits × 0.60 × 0.85 = 1.02 expected procs
- Expected damage per A1: 1.02 procs × 4% MAX HP = 4.08% Clan Boss MAX HP per A1
- Example (UNM Clan Boss 280M HP): 4.08% × 280,000,000 = 11,424,000 damage per A1
- **Damage Loss:** 13.44M - 11.42M = 2.016M damage per A1 (15% loss)

**At 70% C.RATE:**
- Expected Warmaster procs per A1: 2 hits × 0.60 × 0.70 = 0.84 expected procs
- Expected damage per A1: 0.84 procs × 4% MAX HP = 3.36% Clan Boss MAX HP per A1
- Example (UNM Clan Boss 280M HP): 3.36% × 280,000,000 = 9,408,000 damage per A1
- **Damage Loss:** 13.44M - 9.41M = 4.032M damage per A1 (30% loss)

**Conclusion:** Arbiter requires **100% C.RATE** for full Warmaster damage in Clan Boss UNM. Anything below 100% C.RATE results in 15-30% damage loss from Warmaster procs.

**Gear Requirements for 100% C.RATE:**
- **C.RATE Gloves (main stat):** +50-60% C.RATE
- **Deadly Precision (Tier 1 Offense):** +15% C.RATE
- **Substats (Weapon, Helmet, Shield, Chest, Boots, Ring, Amulet, Banner):** +20-25% C.RATE total
- **Total:** 50-60% + 15% + 20-25% = 85-100% C.RATE

**IF NOT Using Warmaster (Arena/Dungeons Support Build):**
- **SKIP C.RATE** = no need for 100% C.RATE (Arbiter is support, not damage dealer)
- Use HP%/DEF% Gloves instead of C.RATE Gloves for survivability

### PVP Masteries (Arena, Faction Wars)

**Tree Distribution:** Defense (Tier 1-6) + Support (Tier 1-6)

#### Defense Tree (Tier 1-6)

**Tier 1:**
- **Defiant** (Rank 3): Increases DEF by 5%/10%/15% for each debuff on this Champion
  * **High value:** Arena enemies apply debuffs (Decrease DEF, Stun, etc.) = Arbiter gains +15% DEF per debuff (stacks)

**Tier 2:**
- **Improved Parry** (Rank 3): Reduces Critical Damage taken by 10%/20%/30%
  * **CRITICAL for Void affinity:** Arbiter is Void (all affinities can crit on her without weak hits) = Improved Parry reduces enemy nuke damage by 30%

**Tier 3:**
- **Rejuvenation** (Rank 3): Heals 3%/6%/9% of MAX HP each turn
  * **Useful for sustain:** Arbiter heals 9% MAX HP per turn (helps survive long Arena battles)

**Tier 4:**
- **Shadow Heal** (Rank 3): Heals 4%/8%/12% of MAX HP when an ally is killed
  * **Useful:** Arbiter heals when ally dies (pairs with A4 revive)

**Tier 5:**
- **Delay Death** (Rank 3): Reduces damage taken from a single hit by 10%/20%/30% if the damage exceeds 25% of MAX HP
  * **CRITICAL for Arena:** Reduces enemy nuke damage by 30% (if damage > 25% MAX HP) = Arbiter survives Wukong/Trunda/Michelangelo nukes

**Tier 6:**
- **Cycle of Revenge** (Rank 1): Increases Turn Meter by 15% when hit by a critical hit
  * **Useful for Void affinity:** Arbiter is Void (all enemies can crit) = +15% TM when crit → Arbiter takes turn faster after enemy nuke

---

#### Support Tree (Tier 1-6)

**Same as PVE Support Tree:**
- **Tier 1:** Pinpoint Accuracy (3)
- **Tier 2:** Exalt in Death (3)
- **Tier 3:** Rapid Response (3)
- **Tier 4:** Lore of Steel (3)
- **Tier 5:** Evil Eye (3)

#### Recommended Team Composition

**Core Team (Based on Common High Elves Roster):**
1. **Arbiter** (Legendary, Void) - Speed Lead + TM Boost + Revive + Increase ATK + Heal
   * **Role:** Core support (TM boost + revive saves runs from boss wipes)

#### Team Strategy for Crypt 21

**Wave Clear:**
1. **Arbiter A3** (TM boost + Increase ATK) → entire team takes turns before trash waves
2. **Elhain A2** (AOE nuke) → clear trash waves
3. **Apothecary A3** (heal) → sustain through trash wave damage
4. **Repeat** until boss wave

**Boss Kill:**
1. **Arbiter A3** (TM boost + Increase ATK) → boost team damage
2. **Arbiter A1** (Weaken 25%) → boss takes 25% more damage
3. **High Elf Champion #4** (Decrease DEF 60%) → boss takes 60% more damage
4. **Elhain A1** (single-target nuke with Weaken + Decrease DEF) → high damage
5. **Apothecary A3** (heal) → sustain through boss AOE attacks
6. **Arbiter A4** (revive if ally dies) → A3 (TM boost) → continue boss kill

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Arbiter MUST be 6-star, full masteries, full books** (A3 + A4 cooldown reduction MANDATORY)
- **Elhain MUST have 100% C.RATE + 200%+ C.DMG** for sufficient wave clear damage
- **Apothecary provides backup TM boost + heal** (keeps team healthy)
- **Decrease DEF champion REQUIRED** for boss kill (Jinglehunter, Magister, or borrowed from other faction if allowed)

### Ideal 5-Champion Pull List (Non-Owned Only)

**Top 5 High Elves Champions to Pull for Faction Wars:**

**1. Lyssandra (Legendary, Magic) - CRITICAL IMPACT**
- **Role:** Speed Lead (30% SPD Arena aura) + TM Booster (30% fill) + TM Control (30% decrease) + AOE Damage
- **Rationale:** Best-in-slot High Elves speed lead + TM control for Crypt 21 boss (prevents boss from taking turns)
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (game-changing for High Elves Faction Wars + Arena)

**2. Belanor (Legendary, Magic) - HIGH IMPACT**
- **Role:** AOE Decrease DEF (60%) + Weaken (25%) + Single-Target Nuke + Increase C.RATE (30%)
- **Rationale:** Belanor places Decrease DEF + Weaken on ALL enemies (boss + trash waves) = massive damage amplification
- **Priority:** HIGH (fills Decrease DEF gap + damage dealer role)

**3. Royal Huntsman (Legendary, Force) - HIGH IMPACT**
- **Role:** AOE Nuke + HP Burn + Decrease DEF (60%) + TM Control (30% decrease)
- **Rationale:** Royal Huntsman provides AOE damage + HP Burn + TM control for boss = complete package
- **Priority:** HIGH (fills damage dealer + HP Burn + TM control roles)

**4. Reliquary Tender (Rare, Void) - MEDIUM IMPACT**
- **Role:** Cleanse (Remove All Debuffs) + Heal + Revive (single ally)
- **Rationale:** Reliquary Tender cleanses debuffs (Decrease DEF, Stun, etc.) + heals + revives = strong sustain support
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (fills sustain role if Apothecary insufficient)

**5. Jinglehunter (Epic, Magic) - MEDIUM IMPACT**
- **Role:** Decrease DEF (60%) + AOE Damage + TM Control (30% decrease)
- **Rationale:** Jinglehunter fills Decrease DEF gap + TM control for boss (prevents boss from taking turns)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (accessible Epic, fills Decrease DEF role)

---

### Faction Wars Priority by User Progress

**Completed Normal:** Orc, Banner Lords, Barbarian, Dwarf - LOW priority (focus on Hard stages later)

**Near Completion:** **High Elf** (Arbiter CRITICAL), Lizardmen, Knights Revenant, Dark Elf - **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Recommendation:** Complete High Elves Crypt 21 FIRST with Arbiter (build Arbiter to 6-star, full masteries, full books)
- **After High Elves:** Focus on Lizardmen, Knights Revenant, Dark Elf (check owned champions for each faction)

**Not Started:** Remaining factions - MEDIUM priority (defer until High Elves complete)

---

## 7. Team Synergies & Pairings

### Best Champions to Pair With (From Owned Roster)

#### Arena Teams (Classic, Tag Team, Live)

**Core Arena Team (User's Confirmed Setup with Arbiter Integration):**

**Team 1: Speed Nuke Team (RECOMMENDED - Arbiter as Speed Lead)**
1. **Arbiter** (speed lead 30% SPD, TM boost, revive) - **300+ SPD**
2. **Mythrala** (buffs/cleanse, hex damage) - **280+ SPD** (boosted by Arbiter aura to ~364 SPD)
3. **Wukong** (buff strip, nuke, sheep control) - **260+ SPD** (boosted by Arbiter aura to ~338 SPD)
4. **Loki** (control, buff strip, suppress mythics/active skills) - **240+ SPD** (boosted by Arbiter aura to ~312 SPD)

**Turn Order:**
1. Arbiter A3 (fastest, 300+ SPD) → fills team TM by 30%, places Increase ATK on all allies
2. Mythrala A3 (280+ SPD + 30% TM boost from Arbiter) → buffs team (Increase DEF, Shield, etc.)
3. Wukong A3 (260+ SPD + 30% TM boost) → removes ALL enemy buffs (immunity, shields, etc.)
4. Wukong A2 (extra turn from A3) → AOE nuke with Increase ATK buff + enemy buffs removed
5. Loki A3 (240+ SPD + 30% TM boost) → suppress enemy mythics/active skills (prevent Arbiter revive, Rector Drath revive, etc.)

**Synergy Analysis:**
- **Arbiter 30% SPD aura** = entire team gains 30% SPD (78-90 SPD boost depending on base Speed)
- **Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost)** = entire team takes turns BEFORE enemy (even if enemy has similar Speed)
- **Arbiter A3 (50% Increase ATK)** = Wukong A2 nuke deals 50% more damage
- **Arbiter A4 (revive + extra turn)** = if Wukong/Mythrala/Loki dies, Arbiter revives → A3 (TM boost) → revived ally nukes enemy
- **Mythrala buffs + Arbiter A3** = team has Increase ATK + Increase DEF + Shield = survive enemy counterattack
- **Wukong buff strip + Arbiter A2** = complete buff control (Wukong removes buffs immediately, Arbiter reduces buff duration)
- **Loki suppress + Arbiter revive** = Loki prevents enemy Arbiter/Rector Drath revive, Arbiter revives allies if needed

**Why This Team is DOMINANT:**
- **Speed advantage:** 30% SPD aura (HIGHEST in owned roster) + 30% TM boost = go first GUARANTEED (unless enemy has 330+ SPD)
- **Damage amplification:** 50% Increase ATK (Arbiter A3) + enemy buffs removed (Wukong A3) = massive nuke damage
- **Control:** Loki suppress prevents enemy comebacks (no revive, no active skills)
- **Safety net:** Arbiter A4 revive transforms losses into wins

#### Dungeons Teams (Dragon, Spider, Fire Knight, Ice Golem)

**Dragon 25 Team (HP Burn + TM Boost):**
1. **Arbiter** (TM boost, revive, Increase ATK, Weaken) - **250-280+ SPD**
2. **Artak** (HP Burn, Decrease DEF, AOE damage) - **220+ SPD**
3. **Ninja** (HP Burn, Freeze, single-target nuke) - **220+ SPD**
4. **Dhukk the Pierced** (Decrease DEF 60%, Weaken 25%, AOE damage) - **200+ SPD**
5. **Vogoth** (sustain, passive healing, Leech) OR **Godseeker Aniri** (revive, Ally Protection, heal) - **180+ SPD**

**Synergy Analysis:**
- **Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost)** = entire team takes more turns = more HP Burns applied per rotation
- **Arbiter A3 (50% Increase ATK)** = Artak/Ninja/Dhukk deal 50% more damage (AOE wave clear + boss kill)
- **Arbiter A1 (Weaken 25%)** + **Dhukk A3 (Decrease DEF 60%)** = Dragon takes 1.60 × 1.25 = 2.0x damage
- **Arbiter A4 (revive)** = saves runs from Dragon breath wipes (especially trash waves)
- **Artak + Ninja HP Burn** = Dragon loses 15% MAX HP per turn (HP Burn damage)
- **Vogoth passive healing** = keeps team healthy through trash waves

**Clear Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes (with Arbiter TM boost, faster than 3-4 minutes without Arbiter)

---

**Spider 25 Team (MAX HP Nuke + TM Boost):**
1. **Arbiter** (TM boost, revive, Increase ATK) - **250-280+ SPD**

3. **Coldheart** (second copy, MAX HP nuke) - **220+ SPD**
4. **Sethalia** (MAX HP nuke 2.5% × 4 hits, AOE Freeze) - **200+ SPD**
5. **Armiger** (TM control 30% decrease, multi-hit A1) OR **Alure** (TM control 100% decrease, multi-hit A1) - **180+ SPD**

**Synergy Analysis:**
- **Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost)** = Coldheart (×2) + Sethalia take more turns = more MAX HP nukes per rotation
- **Arbiter A3 (50% Increase ATK)** = Coldheart/Sethalia MAX HP damage increased by 50% (ATK scaling component)
- **Arbiter A1 (Weaken 25%)** = Spider takes 25% more MAX HP damage from Coldheart/Sethalia nukes
- **Arbiter A4 (revive)** = saves runs from Spiderling swarm wipes
- **Coldheart (×2) A3 (TM control 30% decrease × 2)** = Spider loses 60% TM per rotation (rarely takes turns)
- **Sethalia A3 (AOE Freeze)** = freezes Spiderlings (prevents swarm damage)

**Clear Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes (with Arbiter TM boost + revive safety net)

---

**Fire Knight 25 Team (Multi-Hit Shield Break + TM Boost):**
1. **Arbiter** (TM boost, revive, Increase ATK, 2-hit A1) - **250-280+ SPD**
2. **Alure** (TM control 100% decrease, multi-hit A1) - **220+ SPD**
3. **Coldheart** (MAX HP nuke, 4-hit A1) - **220+ SPD**
4. **Relickeeper** (4-hit A1, AOE damage) - **200+ SPD**
5. **Dhukk the Pierced** (Decrease DEF 60%, AOE damage, 2-hit A2) OR **Armiger** (TM control, multi-hit A1) - **180+ SPD**

**Synergy Analysis:**
- **Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost)** = entire team takes more turns = faster shield break
- **Arbiter A1 (2 hits)** = contributes 2 hits per turn towards shield break
- **Arbiter A3 (50% Increase ATK)** = Coldheart/Relickeeper/Dhukk deal 50% more damage after shield breaks
- **Arbiter A4 (revive)** = saves runs from Fire Knight AOE + counterattack wipes
- **Alure A1 (TM control 100%)** = Fire Knight rarely takes turns after shield breaks
- **Coldheart A3 (MAX HP nuke)** = instant kill after shield breaks (Fire Knight has high MAX HP)

**Clear Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes (with Arbiter TM boost + Alure TM control after shield break)

---

**Ice Golem 25 Team (HP Burn + TM Boost):**
1. **Arbiter** (TM boost, revive, Increase ATK, Weaken, heal) - **250-280+ SPD**
2. **Artak** (HP Burn, Decrease DEF, AOE damage) - **220+ SPD**
3. **Ninja** (HP Burn, Freeze, single-target nuke) - **220+ SPD**
4. **Vogoth** (sustain, passive healing, Leech) - **180+ SPD**
5. **Dhukk the Pierced** (Decrease DEF 60%, Weaken 25%, AOE damage) OR **Rector Drath** (revive, Block Debuffs, heal) - **180+ SPD**

**Synergy Analysis:**
- **Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost)** = entire team takes more turns = more HP Burns applied per rotation
- **Arbiter A3 (heal 25% MAX HP if below 50% HP)** = keeps team healthy through Ice Golem reflect damage
- **Arbiter A1 (Weaken 25%)** + **Dhukk A3 (Decrease DEF 60%)** = Ice Golem takes 2.0x damage
- **Arbiter A4 (revive)** = saves runs from Ice Golem AOE wipes
- **Artak + Ninja HP Burn** = Ice Golem loses 15% MAX HP per turn
- **Vogoth passive healing** = mitigates Ice Golem reflect damage

**Clear Time Estimate:** 3-4 minutes (Ice Golem is slow due to reflect damage + minions, but HP Burn + TM boost speeds up)

---

#### Doom Tower Hard Teams (Boss-Specific)

**Eternal Dragon Hard (Vulnerability Window Burst):**
1. **Arbiter** (TM boost, revive, Increase ATK, Weaken) - **250+ SPD**
2. **Ninja** (Freeze, HP Burn, single-target nuke) - **220+ SPD**
3. **Dhukk the Pierced** (Decrease DEF 60%, Weaken 25%) - **200+ SPD**
4. **Wukong** (buff strip, sheep control, nuke) - **200+ SPD**
5. **Vogoth** (sustain, passive healing) OR **Rector Drath** (revive, Block Debuffs, heal) - **180+ SPD**

**Synergy Analysis:**
- **Eternal Dragon vulnerability window** (after dragon uses A3 Ultimate, dragon is vulnerable for 1 turn)
- **Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost during vulnerability window)** = entire team takes turns BEFORE vulnerability expires = maximum damage
- **Arbiter A3 (50% Increase ATK)** + **Arbiter A1 (Weaken 25%)** + **Dhukk A3 (Decrease DEF 60%)** = Eternal Dragon takes 2.0x damage
- **Ninja A2 (single-target nuke with Decrease DEF + Weaken + Increase ATK)** = massive damage during vulnerability window
- **Arbiter A4 (revive)** = saves runs from Eternal Dragon Ultimate AOE wipes

**Strategy:**
1. Survive Eternal Dragon Ultimate AOE (Phase 1)
2. Arbiter A3 (TM boost + Increase ATK) during vulnerability window
3. Dhukk A3 (Decrease DEF 60% + Weaken 25%)
4. Ninja A2 (single-target nuke with all debuffs active)
5. Wukong A2 (nuke with all debuffs active)
6. Repeat until Eternal Dragon dies

**Scarab King Hard (Revive After Shield Explosion):**
1. **Arbiter** (TM boost, revive, Increase ATK, Weaken) - **250+ SPD**
2. **Godseeker Aniri** (revive, Ally Protection, Block Buffs) - **220+ SPD**
3. **Rector Drath** (revive, Block Debuffs, heal) - **200+ SPD**
4. **Vogoth** (sustain, passive healing, shields) - **180+ SPD**
5. **Dhukk the Pierced** (Decrease DEF 60%, Weaken 25%) OR **Artak** (HP Burn, Decrease DEF) - **180+ SPD**

**Synergy Analysis:**
- **Scarab King shield explosion** = kills all allies when shield reaches max stacks
- **Arbiter A4 (revive ALL allies to 35% HP + 20% TM boost + extra turn)** = instant team revival after shield explosion
- **Arbiter A3 (extra turn after A4)** = fills all TMs by 30% + places Increase ATK + heals allies below 50% HP = revived allies at 60% HP with buffs
- **Godseeker Aniri A4 (revive single ally + Ally Protection)** = backup revive if Arbiter dies
- **Rector Drath A4 (revive single ally + Block Debuffs)** = backup revive if Arbiter + Godseeker die
- **Vogoth passive healing** = keeps team healthy between shield explosions

**Strategy:**
1. Survive Scarab King shield explosion (entire team dies)
2. Arbiter A4 (revive ALL allies to 35% HP + 20% TM boost + extra turn)
3. Arbiter A3 (extra turn) → fills all TMs by 30% + heals allies below 50% HP (revived allies now at 60% HP)
4. Continue damaging Scarab King (HP Burn + Decrease DEF + Weaken)
5. Repeat until Scarab King dies

---

#### Clan Boss UNM Teams (Warmaster Build)

**Clan Boss UNM Team (IF Using Arbiter with Warmaster):**
1. **Arbiter** (TM boost, Increase ATK, Weaken, Warmaster damage) - **220-250+ SPD, 100% C.RATE**
2. **Brogni** (shields, Ally Protection, Block Debuffs, Increase DEF) - **200-220+ SPD**
3. **Frozen Banshee** (poison spam, 5% Poison Sensitivity) - **180-200+ SPD**
4. **Dhukk the Pierced** (Decrease DEF 60%, Weaken 25%, Leech) - **180-200+ SPD**
5. **Godseeker Aniri** (revive, Ally Protection, heal, extend buffs) OR **Vogoth** (sustain, passive healing) - **170-190+ SPD**

**Synergy Analysis:**
- **Arbiter A3 (30% TM boost)** = entire team takes more turns per rotation = more poison stacks + Warmaster procs
- **Arbiter A3 (50% Increase ATK)** = Brogni/Dhukk/Frozen Banshee deal 50% more damage
- **Arbiter A1 (Weaken 25%)** + **Dhukk A3 (Decrease DEF 60%)** = Clan Boss takes 2.0x damage
- **Arbiter A1 (Warmaster procs at 100% C.RATE)** = 1.2 expected procs per A1 = 4.8% Clan Boss MAX HP per A1
- **Brogni shields + Ally Protection** = team survives Clan Boss AOE attacks (especially Stun target AOE)
- **Frozen Banshee poison spam** = Clan Boss loses 50,000 HP per turn per poison stack (max 10 stacks)
- **Godseeker Aniri Ally Protection** = protects Frozen Banshee from Clan Boss single-target attacks

**Damage Estimate:** 25-35M per key (with Arbiter Warmaster build + Brogni shields + Frozen Banshee poison)

**Why Arbiter is 8/10 for Clan Boss UNM (not 10/10):**
- User has **Pain Keeper (×3)** = unkillable cheese potential (Triple Pain Keeper + Block Damage champions)
- User has **Brogni** = superior defensive support (shields + Ally Protection + Block Debuffs)
- Arbiter is EXCELLENT for general Clan Boss teams but NOT optimal for unkillable/speed tune strategies
- **Recommendation:** Build Arbiter for Arena FIRST, adapt for Clan Boss later if needed

---

### Cheese Strategy Potential (From Owned Roster)

**No Direct Cheese Strategy for Arbiter:**
- Arbiter does NOT enable specific cheese strategies (e.g., unkillable, ally attack spam, MAX HP nuke spam)
- However, Arbiter **ENHANCES** cheese strategies:
  * **Triple Coldheart + Arbiter** = Arbiter A3 (TM boost) → Coldheart (×3) A3 (MAX HP nuke × 3) = instant boss kill
  * **Double Nogdar + Arbiter** = Arbiter A3 (TM boost + Increase ATK) → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack again) = back-to-back ally attacks

**Best Cheese Integration:**
1. **Triple Coldheart + Arbiter + Ally Attack champion** (Fire Knight, Spider, Doom Tower bosses)
   - Arbiter A3 (TM boost + Increase ATK) → Coldheart (×3) A3 (MAX HP nuke) = 12% + 12% + 12% = 36% boss MAX HP damage per rotation
2. **Double Nogdar + Arbiter + 2 Nukers** (Clan Boss, Dungeons)
   - Arbiter A3 (TM boost + Increase ATK) → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → entire team attacks → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack again) = 3x attacks per rotation

### Similar Champions with Comparable Utility

**Champions with Similar Support Kits (In Game, Not Necessarily Owned):**

**1. Lyssandra (Legendary, Magic, High Elves) - NOT OWNED**
- **Similarities:** 30% SPD aura (Arena), 30% TM boost (A2), AOE Decrease Buff Duration (A3), TM control (30% decrease A2)
- **Differences:** Lyssandra provides TM control (30% decrease) instead of revive (Arbiter A4) = better for boss control, worse for safety net
- **User Note:** Lyssandra would be IDEAL pull for High Elves Faction Wars + Arena (similar to Arbiter but with TM control)

**2. Siphi the Lost Bride (Legendary, Magic, Undead Hordes) - NOT OWNED**
- **Similarities:** 30% SPD aura (All Battles), 30% TM boost (A2), Revive (A3), Increase SPD buff (A2)
- **Differences:** Siphi provides Increase SPD + Continuous Heal instead of Increase ATK = better for sustain, similar revive
- **User Note:** Siphi is GAME-CHANGING (30% SPD aura for ALL content, not just Arena) but extremely rare

**3. Duchess Lilitu (Legendary, Magic, Demonspawn) - NOT OWNED**
- **Similarities:** Revive ALL allies (A3), Block Debuffs (A2), Increase ATK + Increase DEF (A2), heal (A3)
- **Differences:** Duchess provides Block Debuffs + shields instead of TM boost = better for defensive teams, worse for speed teams
- **User Note:** Duchess is IDEAL for Doom Tower Hard (Block Debuffs prevents boss debuffs) but lacks TM boost for speed teams

**Owned Champions Comparison (Validated):**
- **Arbiter vs Apothecary:** Arbiter SUPERIOR (30% TM boost + revive + Increase ATK vs 15% TM boost + heal only)
- **Arbiter vs Godseeker Aniri:** Arbiter SUPERIOR for SPEED (30% TM boost + extra turn on revive vs single revive + Ally Protection)
- **Arbiter vs Rector Drath:** Arbiter SUPERIOR for SPEED (30% TM boost vs revive + Block Debuffs sustain)

**Conclusion:** Arbiter is **UNIQUE** in owned roster for combining 30% SPD aura (Arena) + 30% TM boost + revive + Increase ATK + extra turn. No other owned champion provides this complete support package.

## 8. Investment Recommendations

### Priority Level: **CRITICAL**

**Rationale:**
- **User's Arena Team:** Current speed lead is Wukong (24% SPD aura). Upgrading to Arbiter (30% SPD aura) = 6% SPD increase for entire team = +15-30 SPD boost (depending on base Speed)
- **User's High Elves Faction Wars:** "Near Completion: High Elf" = Arbiter is CRITICAL for completing High Elves Crypt 21
- **User's Dungeons:** Arbiter improves Dragon 25, Fire Knight 25, Doom Tower Hard clear times by 30-50% (TM boost + revive safety net)
- **Universal Support:** Arbiter fits in ALL content (Arena, Dungeons, Doom Tower, Faction Wars, Clan Boss)

**Investment Priority Breakdown:**

**Priority 1: Level & Ascension**
- **6-Star Ascension (6★)**: MANDATORY
  * Arbiter MUST be 6-starred for Arena (survive enemy nukes), Dungeons (survive boss AOE), Faction Wars (Crypt 21 bosses hit HARD)
  * Example: Arbiter at 5-star has 13,762 HP. At 6-star: 16,515 HP (+20% HP). With HP% gear: 16,515 × 2.5 = 41,287 HP (not enough). Need 50,000+ HP for Arena Gold 4+ survivability.
- **Full Ascension (6 stars)**: MANDATORY
  * Ascension unlocks base stat increases (HP, DEF, SPD) + additional skill upgrades
  * Example: Arbiter base SPD at full ascension: 110 SPD (vs 100 SPD at no ascension) = +10 SPD before gear

**Priority 2: Skill Books**
- **CRITICAL: A3 + A4 Cooldown Reduction (3 Legendary books total)**
  * **A3:** 4 turns → 3 turns (1 book) = MANDATORY for Arena (30% TM boost every 3 turns)
  * **A4:** 7 turns → 5 turns (2 books) = MANDATORY for Arena + Dungeons (revive every 5 turns instead of 7)
  * **WITHOUT A3 + A4 books, Arbiter is TOO SLOW for Arena and Dungeons**
- **HIGH: A2 Debuff Chance (3 books)**
  * **A2:** 75% → 100% Decrease Buff Duration chance (3 books) = consistent buff control in Arena, Hydra, Doom Tower
  * Recommended if Legendary books available after A3 + A4 books
- **MEDIUM: A1 Debuff Chance (3 books)**
  * **A1:** 30% → 50% Weaken chance (3 books) = more consistent Weaken procs for damage amplification
  * OPTIONAL if Legendary books scarce (prioritize A3 + A4 + A2 first)

**Partial Booking Strategy (Budget-Conscious):**
- **Minimum Investment:** Book A3 + A4 ONLY (3 Legendary books) = functional for Arena + Dungeons
- **Skip:** A1 + A2 books if Legendary books scarce (use Arbiter for TM boost + revive only, not debuff focus)

**Priority 3: Masteries**
- **CRITICAL: Full Masteries (30 points)**
  * **PVP Build (Arena, Faction Wars):** Defense (Tier 1-6) + Support (Tier 1-6)
  * **PVE Build (Clan Boss, Dungeons):** Offense (Tier 1-6) + Support (Tier 1-6)
  * **User Priority:** Build PVP masteries FIRST (Arena focus), re-spec to PVE later if using Arbiter for Clan Boss
- **Cost:** 800 Gems per full mastery scroll OR farm Minotaur 15 (12-15 hours of farming per champion)
- **Recommendation:** Use Gems (800 Gems) to save time, OR farm Minotaur 15 during Double XP events

**Priority 4: Gear**
- **CRITICAL: Speed Boots (MANDATORY)**
  * Arbiter MUST use Speed Boots (main stat) for 300+ SPD in Arena
  * Cost: Farm Dragon 25 for Speed Set boots with Speed main stat (rare drop, may take 100+ runs)
- **CRITICAL: Accuracy Banner/Chest (MANDATORY for Dungeons/Doom Tower)**
  * Arbiter needs 200-250+ ACC for Dungeons 25 and Doom Tower Hard (land Weaken + Decrease Buff Duration)
  * Cost: Farm Dragon 25 for Accuracy Chest OR farm Spider 25 for Accuracy Banner
- **HIGH: HP%/DEF% Gloves (RECOMMENDED for Arena survivability)**
  * Arbiter needs 50,000+ HP + 2,500+ DEF to survive enemy nukes in Arena Gold 4+
  * Cost: Farm Dragon 25 for HP%/DEF% Gloves with Speed substats
- **OPTIONAL: C.RATE Gloves (IF using Warmaster for Clan Boss)**
  * Arbiter needs 100% C.RATE for full Warmaster proc rate (see Masteries section)
  * Cost: Farm Dragon 25 for C.RATE Gloves with Speed + Accuracy substats

**When to Stop Investment:**

**Minimum Viable Build (Arena Focus):**
- **Level:** 6-star, full ascension
- **Books:** A3 + A4 cooldown reduction ONLY (3 Legendary books)
- **Masteries:** PVP Build (Defense + Support, 30 points)
- **Gear:** Speed Boots, HP%/DEF% Gloves, Accuracy Chest, Speed Set (4 pieces) + Divine Speed Set (2 pieces)
- **Stats:** 300+ SPD, 180-200+ ACC, 50,000+ HP, 2,500+ DEF
- **Result:** Functional Arena speed lead + TM booster + reviver

**Optimal Build (Arena + Dungeons + Doom Tower):**
- **Level:** 6-star, full ascension
- **Books:** Full books (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4, 9 Legendary books total)
- **Masteries:** PVP Build (Defense + Support, 30 points) OR PVE Build (Offense + Support, 30 points)
- **Gear:** Speed Boots, HP%/DEF% Gloves, Accuracy Chest, Speed Set (4 pieces) + Divine Speed Set (2 pieces) with high-quality substats (Speed, Accuracy, HP%, DEF%)
- **Stats:** 300+ SPD, 250+ ACC, 50,000+ HP, 2,500+ DEF
- **Result:** Best-in-class Arena speed lead + TM booster + reviver + buff control + damage amplification

**When to Re-Spec (Clan Boss Focus):**
- **IF:** User decides to use Arbiter for Clan Boss UNM (Warmaster damage contribution)
- **THEN:** Re-spec masteries from PVP Build (Defense + Support) to PVE Build (Offense + Support with Warmaster)
- **ALSO:** Replace HP%/DEF% Gloves with C.RATE Gloves (100% C.RATE for full Warmaster proc rate)
- **Cost:** 150 Gems per mastery re-spec

### PVE Disclaimer

**This champion requires booking/building for optimal performance in:**
- **Arena (Classic, Tag Team, Live):** Full books (A3 + A4 cooldown reduction MANDATORY), PVP masteries, 300+ SPD
- **Dungeons 25 (Dragon, Fire Knight, Ice Golem):** Full books (A3 + A4 cooldown reduction MANDATORY), PVE masteries, 250-280+ SPD
- **Doom Tower Hard:** Full books (A3 + A4 cooldown reduction MANDATORY), PVE masteries, 250+ SPD, 250+ ACC
- **High Elves Faction Wars:** Full books (A3 + A4 cooldown reduction MANDATORY), PVP masteries, 300+ SPD

**WITHOUT full books (A3 + A4 cooldown reduction), Arbiter is TOO SLOW for competitive play:**
- A3 cooldown: 4 turns (base) vs 3 turns (fully booked) = 33% slower TM boost cycle
- A4 cooldown: 7 turns (base) vs 5 turns (fully booked) = 40% slower revive cycle
- **Example:** In Arena Gold 4+, enemies kill 1 ally per turn. Without A4 books, Arbiter revives at turn 7 (entire team already dead). With A4 books, Arbiter revives at turn 5 (2 allies still alive, revive saves run).

**Partial Investment Viability:**
- **Minimum Investment (3 books):** A3 + A4 cooldown reduction ONLY = functional for Arena + Dungeons (70% optimal performance)
- **Skip A1 + A2 books:** Arbiter can function without A1 + A2 books (use for TM boost + revive only, not debuff focus)

---

### Investment ROI (Return on Investment)

**Arena (Classic, Tag Team, Live):**
- **Investment:** 6-star, A3 + A4 books (3 books), PVP masteries, 300+ SPD gear
- **Return:** 30% SPD aura (BEST in owned roster) = +15-30 SPD boost for entire team = higher win rate in Gold 4+ (60% → 75% estimated)
- **ROI:** **CRITICAL** - Arbiter is MANDATORY upgrade for Arena (replaces Wukong as speed lead)

**Dungeons 25 (Dragon, Fire Knight, Ice Golem):**
- **Investment:** 6-star, A3 + A4 books (3 books), PVE masteries, 250-280+ SPD gear
- **Return:** 30% TM boost = 30-50% faster clear times (3-4 min → 2-3 min)
- **ROI:** **HIGH** - Arbiter improves clear speed + revive safety net = more efficient farming

**Doom Tower Hard:**
- **Investment:** 6-star, A3 + A4 books (3 books), PVE masteries, 250+ SPD, 250+ ACC gear
- **Return:** 30% TM boost during boss vulnerability windows + revive + extra turn = consistent boss kills + Secret Room clears
- **ROI:** **HIGH** - Arbiter is BEST-IN-CLASS support for Doom Tower Hard boss floors

**High Elves Faction Wars:**
- **Investment:** 6-star, A3 + A4 books (3 books), PVP masteries, 300+ SPD gear
- **Return:** Complete High Elves Crypt 21 (user confirmed "Near Completion: High Elf") = unlock Lydia the Deathsiren (reward for completing all factions)
- **ROI:** **CRITICAL** - Arbiter is MANDATORY for High Elves Faction Wars completion

**Clan Boss UNM (OPTIONAL):**
- **Investment:** 6-star, A3 + A4 books (3 books), PVE masteries (Warmaster), 100% C.RATE, 220-250+ SPD gear
- **Return:** 25-35M damage per key (with Brogni shields + Frozen Banshee poison)
- **ROI:** **MEDIUM** - User has Pain Keeper (×3) for unkillable cheese + Brogni for superior defensive support = Arbiter is backup/alternate for Clan Boss

**Overall Investment Priority:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Arena (replace Wukong as speed lead, 30% SPD aura > 24% SPD aura)
2. **HIGH:** High Elves Faction Wars (complete Crypt 21, user confirmed "Near Completion")
3. **HIGH:** Dungeons 25 (30-50% faster clear times with TM boost)
4. **HIGH:** Doom Tower Hard (BEST-IN-CLASS support for boss floors + Secret Rooms)
5. **MEDIUM:** Clan Boss UNM (backup/alternate, user has better options for unkillable cheese)

1. **SPD: 280 (current) vs 300+ (recommended)** = **-20 SPD gap**
   - **Impact:** May lose speed battle vs enemy Arbiter/Lyssandra (320-330+ SPD defenses)
   - **Priority 1 Upgrade:** Replace current gear with higher Speed substats (aim for +4-6 SPD per piece on Weapon, Helmet, Shield, Chest, Gloves, Ring, Amulet, Banner)
   - **CRITICAL:** Divine Speed Set applies to BASE SPEED, NOT total speed
   - **Alternative:** Replace Accuracy Set (2 pieces) with Divine Speed Set (2 pieces) = +15% BASE SPD bonus
     * Calculation: Arbiter (110 base SPD) + Speed Set (12%) + Divine Speed Set (15%) = 110 × 1.27 = 139.7 base speed (BEFORE boots/substats)
     * With boots (+50) + substats (+100): 139.7 + 150 = 289.7 total SPD (NOT 322 as incorrectly calculated)
     * **Note:** Divine Speed Set only adds ~10 total SPD vs Accuracy Set (which adds 0 SPD), so focus on SUBSTATS for major speed gains
2. **HP: 45,000 (current) vs 50,000+ (recommended)** = **-5,000 HP gap**
   - **Impact:** May die to enemy Trunda/Wukong/Michelangelo nukes (especially if Decrease DEF applied)
   - **Priority 2 Upgrade:** Replace current Gloves with HP% Gloves (if using DEF% Gloves) OR increase HP% substats on Weapon, Helmet, Shield, Chest, Ring, Amulet
3. **DEF: 2,200 (current) vs 2,500+ (recommended)** = **-300 DEF gap**
   - **Impact:** May die to enemy AOE damage (especially if Decrease DEF applied)
   - **Priority 3 Upgrade:** Increase DEF% substats on Weapon, Helmet, Shield, Chest, Gloves, Ring, Amulet
4. **A1 + A2 books: 0/6 (current) vs 6/6 (recommended)** = **6 books missing**
   - **Impact:** 
     * A1 Weaken proc rate: 30% (current) vs 50% (fully booked) = 20% lower damage amplification consistency
     * A2 Decrease Buff Duration proc rate: 75% (current) vs 100% (fully booked) = 25% lower buff control consistency
   - **Priority 4 Upgrade:** Book A2 FIRST (buff control critical for Arena vs immunity sets, Rector Drath shields, Mythrala buffs), then book A1 (Weaken damage amplification)
   - **Alternative:** If Legendary books scarce, SKIP A1 + A2 books (Arbiter functional with A3 + A4 books only for TM boost + revive)

**Prioritize Upgrades (User-Specific):**
1. **Priority 1:** Increase SPD to 300+ (replace Accuracy Set with Divine Speed Set OR increase SPD substats by +4-6 per piece)
2. **Priority 2:** Increase HP to 50,000+ (replace Gloves with HP% Gloves OR increase HP% substats)
3. **Priority 3:** Book A2 (Decrease Buff Duration 75% → 100%) for consistent buff control in Arena
4. **Priority 4:** Increase DEF to 2,500+ (increase DEF% substats)

**Re-Spec Recommendation:**
- **Current Build:** PVP Masteries (Defense + Support with Cycle of Revenge) = CORRECT for Arena Gold 4 ✅
- **No re-spec needed** unless user decides to use Arbiter for Clan Boss UNM (re-spec to PVE Masteries: Offense + Support with Warmaster)

**Optimization Result:**
- **Current Build Performance:** 70% optimal for Arena Gold 4 (functional but not optimized)
- **After Upgrades:** 95% optimal for Arena Gold 4 (300+ SPD + 50,000+ HP + 2,500+ DEF + A2 books)

## 10. Cheese Strategy Integration

### No Direct Cheese Strategy for Arbiter

Arbiter does NOT enable specific cheese strategies on her own (e.g., unkillable, ally attack spam, MAX HP nuke spam, buff extension cheese). However, Arbiter **ENHANCES** existing cheese strategies by providing:
- **30% Turn Meter boost (A3)** = cheese champions take more turns per rotation
- **50% Increase ATK buff (A3)** = cheese champions deal 50% more damage
- **Revive + Extra Turn (A4)** = if cheese strategy fails, Arbiter revives team → A3 (TM boost) → continue cheese

---

### Cheese Strategy #1: Triple Coldheart MAX HP Nuke Cheese

**Champions Required:**
- **Arbiter** (TM boost, Increase ATK, revive)
- **Coldheart** (x3) - Epic, Magic, Dark Elves - USER HAS 2 COPIES (needs 1 more)
- **Ally Attack Champion** (Nogdar, Longbeard, Lanakis, etc.) - USER HAS **Nogdar (x2)**

**Cheese Viability:** **HIGH** (User has 2 Coldheart + 2 Nogdar = partial cheese potential)

**Safety Level:** **SAFE** (consistent, reliable, not RNG-dependent IF Coldhearts have 100% C.RATE + 200+ ACC)

**Content Applications:**
- **Fire Knight 25:** Arbiter A3 → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → Coldheart (×3) A3 (MAX HP nuke) = instant shield break + boss kill
- **Spider 25:** Arbiter A3 → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → Coldheart (×3) A3 (MAX HP nuke) = instant boss kill (36% MAX HP damage)
- **Doom Tower Hard (high HP bosses):** Arbiter A3 → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → Coldheart (×3) A3 (MAX HP nuke) = burst damage during vulnerability windows

**Setup Requirements:**
- **Coldhearts:** 100% C.RATE (for consistent Heartseeker A3 damage), 200+ ACC (land TM decrease), 220+ SPD (fast rotation)
- **Nogdar:** 220+ SPD (go before Coldhearts), high Accuracy (land Decrease DEF), high HP/DEF (survive boss AOE)
- **Arbiter:** 250+ SPD (go first), 200+ ACC (land Weaken for additional damage amplification)

**Expected Results:**
- **Fire Knight 25:** 1-2 minute clear (instant shield break + boss kill after shield breaks)
- **Spider 25:** 1-2 minute clear (instant boss kill with 36% MAX HP damage per rotation)
- **Doom Tower Hard:** High burst damage during boss vulnerability windows (Eternal Dragon, Scarab King, etc.)

**User-Specific Note:**
- **USER HAS:** Coldheart (x2), Nogdar (x2)
- **USER NEEDS:** 1 more Coldheart for triple Coldheart cheese (pull from Ancient/Sacred Shards)
- **CURRENT CHEESE POTENTIAL:** Double Coldheart + Double Nogdar + Arbiter = HIGH damage (24% MAX HP per rotation instead of 36%)

---

### Cheese Strategy #2: Double Nogdar Ally Attack Spam Cheese

**Champions Required:**
- **Arbiter** (TM boost, Increase ATK, revive)
- **Nogdar the Headhunter** (x2) - Legendary, Force, Ogryn Tribes - USER HAS **Nogdar (x2)** ✅
- **2 Nukers** (Wukong, Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart, etc.) - USER HAS ALL ✅

**Cheese Viability:** **CRITICAL** (User has 2 Nogdar = cheese strategy READY TO USE)

**Safety Level:** **SAFE** (consistent, reliable, not RNG-dependent IF Nogdars have high Speed + Accuracy)

**Content Applications:**
- **Clan Boss UNM:** Arbiter A3 → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → entire team attacks → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack again) = 3x attacks per rotation (30% more damage)
- **Dungeons 25:** Arbiter A3 → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → entire team attacks → faster wave clear + boss kill
- **Doom Tower Hard:** Arbiter A3 → Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → entire team attacks during boss vulnerability windows

**Setup Requirements:**
- **Nogdars (x2):** 220+ SPD (go after Arbiter, before nukers), 200+ ACC (land Decrease DEF), high HP/DEF (survive boss AOE)
- **Nukers (Wukong, Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart):** 100% C.RATE, 200%+ C.DMG, 3k+ ATK (maximize damage during Ally Attacks)
- **Arbiter:** 250+ SPD (go first), A3 (TM boost + Increase ATK) before Nogdars

**Expected Results:**
- **Clan Boss UNM:** 30-40M damage per key (with Ally Attack spam + Brogni shields + Frozen Banshee poison)
- **Dungeons 25:** 1-2 minute clear (Ally Attack spam = faster wave clear + boss kill)
- **Doom Tower Hard:** High burst damage during boss vulnerability windows (Eternal Dragon, Scarab King, etc.)

**Turn Order Example (Clan Boss UNM):**
1. Arbiter A3 (TM boost + Increase ATK)
2. Nogdar A3 (Ally Attack) → entire team attacks Clan Boss (Wukong, Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart, Arbiter)
3. Nogdar (second copy) A3 (Ally Attack) → entire team attacks Clan Boss AGAIN
4. Result: 3x attacks per rotation (Arbiter A3 → Nogdar A3 → Nogdar A3) = 30% more damage per rotation

**User-Specific Note:**
- **USER HAS:** Nogdar (x2), Wukong, Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart, Arbiter
- **CHEESE STATUS:** READY TO USE (no additional pulls needed)
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Build Double Nogdar + Arbiter team for Clan Boss UNM (30-40M damage per key estimated)

---

### Cheese Strategy #3: Revive Loop Cheese (Scarab King Hard)

**Champions Required:**
- **Arbiter** (revive ALL allies + extra turn → A3 TM boost)
- **Godseeker Aniri** (revive single ally + Ally Protection + extend buffs)
- **Rector Drath** (revive single ally + Block Debuffs + heal)
- **Vogoth** (sustain, passive healing, shields)
- **Damage Dealer** (Artak HP Burn, Ninja HP Burn, Dhukk Decrease DEF, etc.)

**Cheese Viability:** **MEDIUM** (User has Arbiter + Godseeker Aniri + Rector Drath + Vogoth = cheese strategy READY TO USE)

**Safety Level:** **SAFE** (consistent, reliable, not RNG-dependent IF revive cooldowns managed)

**Content Applications:**
- **Scarab King Hard:** Arbiter A4 (revive ALL allies after shield explosion) → Godseeker A4 (revive + Ally Protection if Arbiter dies) → Rector Drath A4 (revive + Block Debuffs if Godseeker dies) = survive multiple shield explosions
- **Doom Tower Hard Secret Rooms:** Multiple revivers = survive multi-boss wipes

**Setup Requirements:**
- **Arbiter:** A4 cooldown reduction (5 turns), 250+ SPD, PVP masteries (survivability)
- **Godseeker Aniri:** A4 cooldown reduction, 220+ SPD, high HP/DEF (survive shield explosions)
- **Rector Drath:** A4 cooldown reduction, 200+ SPD, high HP/DEF (survive shield explosions)
- **Vogoth:** High HP (100k+), high DEF (3k+), passive healing (keep team healthy between shield explosions)

**Expected Results:**
- **Scarab King Hard:** Survive 5+ shield explosions (revive loop = entire team revives after each explosion) = consistent clear

**Strategy:**
1. Damage Scarab King (HP Burn + Decrease DEF + Weaken)
2. Scarab King shield reaches max stacks → shield explosion → entire team dies
3. Arbiter A4 (revive ALL allies to 35% HP + 20% TM + extra turn)
4. Arbiter A3 (extra turn) → fills all TMs by 30% + heals allies below 50% HP (revived allies now at 60% HP)
5. Vogoth passive healing → allies at 70%+ HP
6. Repeat until Scarab King dies

**User-Specific Note:**
- **USER HAS:** Arbiter, Godseeker Aniri, Rector Drath, Vogoth, Artak, Ninja, Dhukk
- **CHEESE STATUS:** READY TO USE (no additional pulls needed)
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Use revive loop for Scarab King Hard (survive multiple shield explosions)

### Cheese Strategy Priority (User-Specific)

**Priority 1: Double Nogdar Ally Attack Spam Cheese (READY TO USE - CRITICAL)**
- **User has:** Nogdar (x2), Arbiter, Wukong, Ninja, Michelangelo, Coldheart
- **Content:** Clan Boss UNM (30-40M damage per key), Dungeons 25, Doom Tower Hard
- **Investment:** Build Nogdar (x2) to 6-star, full masteries, 220+ SPD, 200+ ACC
- **ROI:** HIGH (30% more damage per rotation in Clan Boss = 5-10M extra damage per key)

**Priority 2: Revive Loop Cheese for Scarab King Hard (READY TO USE - HIGH)**
- **User has:** Arbiter, Godseeker Aniri, Rector Drath, Vogoth, Artak, Ninja, Dhukk
- **Content:** Scarab King Hard (Doom Tower Hard Floor 120)
- **Investment:** Full books on Arbiter A4 (5 turns), Godseeker A4, Rector Drath A4 for fast revive rotations
- **ROI:** HIGH (complete Scarab King Hard = unlock Doom Tower Hard rewards)

**Priority 3: Triple Coldheart MAX HP Nuke Cheese (NEEDS 1 MORE COLDHEART - MEDIUM)**
- **User has:** Coldheart (x2), Nogdar (x2), Arbiter
- **User needs:** 1 more Coldheart (pull from Ancient/Sacred Shards)
- **Content:** Fire Knight 25, Spider 25, Doom Tower Hard (high HP bosses)
- **Investment:** Pull 1 more Coldheart + build all 3 to 6-star, 100% C.RATE, 200+ ACC
- **ROI:** MEDIUM (faster clear times, but user already has strong Dungeon teams)
