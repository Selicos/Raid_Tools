## Content-Specific Ratings (X/10 Contextualized to Owned Champions)

### **PRIORITY 1: CLAN BOSS UNM** 
**Rating: 9/10** ⭐ **EXCELLENT**

**Why 9/10:**
- **Owned comparison:** Geomancer (10/10 - passive MAX HP damage king), Frozen Banshee (7/10 - poison only), Skullcrusher (10/10 - counterattack enabler)
- **Strengths:** AoE cleanse (A2), dual 5% Poison debuffs (2 turns), AoE heal + Continuous Heal, passive +20% damage vs Poisoned enemies
- **Why not 10/10:** Geomancer's passive HP Burn + Reflect damage edges out for raw damage; Bad-el excels at **sustain teams**
- **Unique value:** Only **AoE cleanser + healer + poisoner** combo in your roster
- **Team synergy:** Pairs with Geomancer (HP Burn + Poison = dual MAX HP damage), Skullcrusher (Counterattack + Poison = constant debuff uptime), Frozen Banshee (Poison spam + Bad-el passive = +20% damage boost)

### **PRIORITY 2: DUNGEONS (Dragon, Ice Golem, Spider, Fire Knight)**
**Rating: 10/10** ⭐⭐ **BEST-IN-CLASS** for solo farming

**Why 10/10:**
- **Owned comparison:** No other champion can **solo farm Dragon 25 + Ice Golem 25** with 4 fodders
- **Strengths:** Self-sustaining (A1 AoE heal 20% of damage), AoE cleanse (removes Dec DEF/Weaken), Poison damage (MAX HP-based, ignores boss DEF)
- **Solo farming capability:** Can solo Nightmare Campaign, Dragon 20/25, Ice Golem 20/25 (validated by Chofly videos, community consensus)
- **Energy efficiency:** GAME-CHANGING - Farm with 4 fodders = 5x XP efficiency vs standard teams
- **Unmatched:** No owned champion offers this level of self-sufficiency for farming

### **PRIORITY 3: DOOM TOWER HARD**
**Rating: 9/10** ⭐ **EXCELLENT**

**Why 9/10:**
- **Strengths:** AoE cleanse (critical for boss debuffs like Sand Devil's Dec SPD/ACC, Celestial Griffin's stuns), sustained healing (Continuous Heal 2 turns), Poison damage (MAX HP-based for high-HP bosses)
- **Boss-specific value:** Sand Devil (cleanse Dec SPD/ACC), Celestial Griffin (cleanse stuns), Magma Dragon (Poison damage), Eternal Dragon (sustain healing)
- **Why not 10/10:** No revive capability (Scyl, Arbiter, Godseeker have revive covered), so not a complete solo solution
- **Team synergy:** Pairs with Scyl (revive + stun), Godseeker Aniri (revive all), Vogoth (tank + passive Sleep)

### **PRIORITY 4: ARENA (Classic Gold 3+)**
**Rating: 5/10** (Usable but not optimal)

**Why 5/10:**
- **Strengths:** +25% Crit Rate aura ✅ **SAFE** (works "in all Battles"), AoE cleanse, sustain healing
- **Weaknesses:** No burst damage, no crowd control, too slow for speed-meta Arena (sustain doesn't win vs nuke teams)
- **Owned comparison:** Wukong (10/10 - speed lead + nuke + sheep), Arbiter (9/10 - speed lead + revive), Mithrala (8/10 - hex damage + buffs), Loki (8/10 - control + suppress)
- **Use case:** Tanky sustain defense teams only (not user's preferred playstyle - user prefers Wukong speed lead + Mythrala + Loki control)
- **Recommendation:** Skip for Arena, focus on PVE content

### **PRIORITY 5: FACTION WARS (Undead Hordes)**
**Rating: 8/10** ⭐ **EXCELLENT**

**Why 8/10:**
- **Owned Undead Hordes champions:** Bad-el-Kazar (Legendary Force), Mithrala Lifebane (Legendary Spirit), Frozen Banshee (Rare Spirit), Dark Kael (Epic Force), Dark Athel (Rare Magic), Mausoleum Mage (Epic Void), Paragon (Rare Void)
- **Strengths:** Healing + cleanse + Poison for Faction Wars boss fights (long sustain battles)
- **Team synergy:** Pairs with Mithrala (hex damage + buffs), Frozen Banshee (poison spam), Mausoleum Mage (Inc DEF + Block Debuffs + cleanse)
- **Why not 10/10:** No revive (limits progression in Faction Wars Hard 21), no speed lead (slower clears)
- **Recommendation:** Core member of Undead Hordes Faction Wars team for Normal → Hard progression

## Skills & Mechanics

### **A1: Dark Sphere** (No Cooldown)
- **Effect:** Attacks all enemies. Heals this champion and all allies by 20% of damage inflicted.
- **Multiplier:** 2.8 ATK
- **Books (4 total):** +5% DMG → +5% DMG → +10% Heal → +10% DMG → +10% Heal
- **Fully Booked:** +20% damage, +20% heal (heals 24% of damage inflicted)
- **Key Mechanic:** **AoE heal on default attack** = self-sustaining in long fights (no cooldown = every turn)
- **Synergy:** Pairs with Skullcrusher Counterattack (extra turns = extra heals), Stalwart set (reduce AoE damage taken = higher net healing)

### **A2: Malice** (Cooldown: 5 turns → 3 turns booked)
- **Effect:** Removes all debuffs from all allies. Places two 15% Continuous Heal buffs on all allies for 2 turns. Places two 5% Poison debuffs on all enemies for 2 turns.
- **Books (2 total):** -1 Cooldown → -1 Cooldown
- **Fully Booked:** 3-turn cooldown (CRITICAL for Clan Boss/Doom Tower)
- **Key Mechanic:** **Triple utility** (cleanse + heal + poison) in one skill
- **Synergy:** Pairs with Frozen Banshee (Poison extension via Bad-el passive), Geomancer (Poison + HP Burn = dual MAX HP damage), Reflex set (reduces cooldown further, community-validated by WarToad Feb 2025)

### **Passive: Prey Upon**
- **Effect:** All allies inflict 20% more damage against targets under Poison debuffs.
- **Key Mechanic:** **Team-wide damage boost** when enemies are Poisoned (applies to all damage types EXCEPT Warmaster/Giant Slayer procs)
- **Synergy:** Pairs with Frozen Banshee (Poison spam), Geomancer (HP Burn + Poison combo), any poison-heavy team
- **CRITICAL NOTE:** Passive does NOT stack (multiple Bad-els = only 1 passive active, confirmed by Ayumilove 2020-02-17)

### **Aura: +25% Critical Rate "in all Battles"** ✅ **SAFE**
- **Validation Status:** ✅ CONFIRMED SAFE (works in Doom Tower, Dungeons, Arena, Clan Boss, all content)
- **Wording:** "Increases Ally Critical Rate in all Battles by 25%"
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (Crit Rate less critical than HP/DEF/SPD auras for user's priorities)
- **Use Case:** Benefits damage dealers (Ninja, Wukong, Geomancer) but not top-priority aura for PVE sustain teams
- **Sources:** Ayumilove (primary), cross-validated with RaidHQ

## Gear Recommendations (Option C: General Sets + Detailed Artifacts)

### **General Sets (PVE Focus - Clan Boss, Dungeons, Doom Tower)**

**OPTION 1: Reflex + Speed** ⭐ **BEST FOR CLAN BOSS UNM**
- **Why:** Reflex reduces A2 cooldown (Malice available every 1-2 turns instead of 3), Speed for turn cycling
- **Pros:** A2 uptime = constant cleanse + heal + Poison, community-validated (WarToad Feb 2025 comment: "I put him in Reflex and that A2 Malice pops so often it's not unusual to have 6 heals/6 poisons up")
- **Cons:** RNG-dependent (cooldown reduction chance-based), Reflex gear harder to farm (Fire Knight Stage 20+)
- **When to use:** Clan Boss UNM, Hydra, long boss fights where A2 uptime critical

**OPTION 2: Frenzy + Perception** ⭐ **BEST FOR SOLO FARMING**
- **Why:** Frenzy grants Turn Meter when hit (faster turns = more heals/cleanses), Perception adds Accuracy
- **Pros:** Non-RNG speed boost (better than Relentless/Reflex for solo), works vs high-damage enemies (Dragon Scorch, Ice Golem counterattack)
- **Cons:** Frenzy gear harder to farm (Doom Tower reward only)
- **When to use:** Solo farming Dragon/Ice Golem, Doom Tower bosses
- **Community validation:** Chofly solo Dragon 25 build uses this combo

**OPTION 3: Stalwart + Speed** ⭐ **BEST FOR AOE-HEAVY CONTENT**
- **Why:** Stalwart reduces AoE damage by 30% (critical for Clan Boss stun, Dragon waves, Sand Devil A1)
- **Pros:** Massive survivability boost in AoE-heavy content (Stalwart + Bad-el heal = ultra-tanky), recommended by community (ChrisS Sept 2023: "Put him in your best Stalwart Set. He is 9/10 times in a place that deals only AoE")
- **Cons:** No extra utility (Accuracy/Speed lower than Perception/Speed combo)
- **When to use:** Clan Boss UNM (AoE stun), Dragon (AoE waves), Ice Golem (AoE counterattack), Sand Devil (AoE Dec SPD/ACC)

**OPTION 4: Immortal + Perception** ⭐ **USER'S CURRENT BUILD** (EXCELLENT)
- **Why:** Immortal provides 15% heal per turn (stacks with A1 heal + A2 Continuous Heal), Perception adds Accuracy
- **Pros:** Ultra-high sustain (triple heal sources), easy to farm (Dragon for Perception, various sources for Immortal)
- **Cons:** No Turn Meter boost (slower than Frenzy) or cooldown reduction (slower than Reflex)
- **When to use:** General PVE content, solo farming (works well once SPD threshold met)
- **User's build:** 2x Immortal, 2x Perception, 1x Fury, 3x Protection = Excellent survivability focus

**OPTION 5: Lifesteal + Speed** (Budget Option - Early Game)
- **Why:** Lifesteal enables solo farming without Frenzy, easy to farm (Dragon Stage 12+)
- **Pros:** Budget-friendly, synergizes with A1 heal (A1 heal + Lifesteal = massive sustain)
- **Cons:** Lower healing than Frenzy (no Turn Meter boost), lower than Immortal (no passive heal)
- **When to use:** Early-mid game before Frenzy/Immortal/Reflex gear available

### **Detailed Artifacts (Priority Stats)**

**Banner:** Accuracy or HP (Accuracy preferred for Poison reliability)  
**Chest:** HP% or DEF% (NOT ATK% - Bad-el has low base ATK, only A1 scales with ATK)  
**Boots:** Speed (almost always) or HP% (only if speed tuning for Counterattack team)  
**Gloves:** HP% or DEF% (NOT Crit Rate/Crit Damage - support role, not damage dealer)  
**Weapon/Helmet/Shield:** Prioritize Speed, Accuracy, HP, DEF substats  

**Stat Targets by Content:**

| Content | Accuracy | Speed | HP | DEF | Resist | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|-----|-----|--------|-------|
| **Clan Boss UNM** | 250+ | 180-220 (speed-tuned) | 50k+ | 3k+ | 150+ | Speed tune with team, Resist prevents Dec DEF/Weaken |
| **Solo Dragon 25** | 260+ | 260+ (lap Dragon) | 60k+ | 3.5k+ | 200+ | Must lap Dragon (Dragon ~150 SPD), high Resist for waves |
| **Doom Tower Hard** | 280+ | 220+ | 55k+ | 3.2k+ | 180+ | High ACC for boss Poisons, high Resist for boss debuffs |
| **Arena Gold 3+** | 200+ | 240+ | 50k+ | 3k+ | 100+ | Not recommended for Arena (skip) |
| **Faction Wars** | 200+ | 200+ | 50k+ | 3k+ | 100+ | Survivability > Speed for boss fights |

**Critical Notes:**
- **DO NOT build ATK%** - Base ATK too low (Legendary Support = low ATK stat), only A1 scales with ATK (Poison = MAX HP damage, not ATK-based)
- **Prioritize HP% > DEF%** - A1/A2 heals scale better with large HP pool (20% of damage = higher heal with high HP)
- **Resist critical for Clan Boss** - Prevents Dec DEF/Weaken debuffs (keeps survivability high, allows longer runs)
- **Speed breakpoints:** 260+ for solo Dragon 25 (lap boss), 180-220 for Clan Boss UNM (speed-tuned with team)

## Faction Wars Advice

### **Owned Undead Hordes Champions:**
1. **Bad-el-Kazar** (Legendary Force) - Healer + Cleanser + Poisoner
2. **Mithrala Lifebane** (Legendary Spirit) - Hex damage + Buffs + +80 ACC aura ✅
3. **Frozen Banshee** (Rare Spirit) - Poison specialist + Sensitivity
4. **Dark Kael** (Epic Force) - Poison + AoE damage
5. **Dark Athel** (Rare Magic) - AoE damage
6. **Mausoleum Mage** (Epic Void) - Cleanse + Inc DEF + Block Debuffs
7. **Paragon** (Rare Void) - Unkillable cheese (niche use)

### **Faction Wars Team Recommendations (Normal/Hard):**

**Team 1: Sustain + Poison (Boss Killer)** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
1. **Bad-el-Kazar** (lead for +25% Crit Rate) - Heal + cleanse + Poison
2. **Mithrala Lifebane** - Hex damage + buffs + +80 ACC aura
3. **Frozen Banshee** - Poison spam + Sensitivity
4. **Mausoleum Mage** - Inc DEF + Block Debuffs + cleanse (backup)
5. **Dark Kael** - Poison + AoE damage

**Strengths:**
- Ultra-high survivability (dual cleanse: Bad-el + Mausoleum Mage, dual heal: Bad-el A1/A2)
- Sustained Poison damage (Bad-el + Frozen Banshee + Dark Kael = 6+ Poisons)
- Passive damage boost (Bad-el passive: +20% damage vs Poisoned enemies)

**Weaknesses:**
- Slow clear speed (no burst damage, relies on sustained Poison)
- No revive (limits progression in Faction Wars Hard 21)

**Estimated Progression:**
- **Faction Wars Normal (1-21):** COMPLETE with this team
- **Faction Wars Hard (1-15):** VIABLE with this team
- **Faction Wars Hard (16-21):** DIFFICULT (may need revive champion or better gear)

### **Ideal 5-Champion Pull List (Non-Owned, Undead Hordes Only):**

1. **Siphi the Lost Bride** (Legendary Void) - **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
   - **Why:** Revive all + TM boost + cleanse, game-changing for Faction Wars Hard 21
   - **Impact:** Enables Hard 21 completion (revive safety net for boss one-shots)

2. **Saito** (Legendary Magic) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - **Why:** HP Burn + Dec DEF, Faction Wars Hard specialist
   - **Impact:** Adds burst damage missing from current roster

3. **Gorgorab** (Epic Magic) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - **Why:** Speed lead + Inc ATK + revive, fills speed gap
   - **Impact:** Faster clears + revive safety net

4. **Urogrim** (Legendary Force) - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - **Why:** AoE damage + sustain (similar kit to Bad-el)
   - **Impact:** Alternative to Bad-el for specific boss mechanics

5. **Rotos the Lost Groom** (Legendary Void) - **LOW PRIORITY**
   - **Why:** Single-target nuke + self-MAX HP restoration
   - **Impact:** Cheese potential for boss kills (not essential)

**Priority:** Complete Undead Hordes Faction Wars Normal (1-21) → Progress to Hard (1-15) → Pull Siphi for Hard (16-21)

## Team Synergies & Pairings

### **Best Owned Champions to Pair With Bad-el:**

#### **Clan Boss UNM:**
1. **Geomancer** (Epic Magic, Barbarians) - HP Burn passive + Bad-el Poison = dual MAX HP damage
2. **Skullcrusher** (Epic Void, Ogryn Tribes) - Counterattack + Bad-el Poison/heal = constant debuff/heal uptime
3. **Frozen Banshee** (Rare Spirit, Undead Hordes) - Poison spam + Bad-el passive (+20% damage vs Poison) = massive damage boost
4. **Tayrel** (Epic Spirit, High Elves) - Dec DEF A1 + Bad-el cleanse/heal = sustained debuff + survivability
5. **Rhazin Scarhide** (Legendary Magic, Lizardmen) - Dec DEF/Weaken + TM control + Bad-el cleanse = full debuff suite

**Sample Clan Boss UNM Team:**
- Skullcrusher (Counterattack), Bad-el-Kazar (cleanse + heal + Poison), Geomancer (HP Burn passive), Frozen Banshee (Poison spam), Tayrel (Dec DEF A1)

#### **Dungeons (Solo Farming):**
- **Bad-el solo** with 4 fodders (Dragon 25, Ice Golem 25, Nightmare Campaign)
- **Energy efficiency:** 5x XP vs standard teams = GAME-CHANGING

#### **Doom Tower Hard (Boss Fights):**
1. **Scyl of the Drakes** (Legendary Spirit, Barbarians) - Revive + stun + Bad-el heal/cleanse = ultra-sustain
2. **Godseeker Aniri** (Epic Void, Sacred Order) - Revive all + heal + Bad-el cleanse = triple safety net
3. **Vogoth** (Epic Force, Demonspawn) - Tank + passive Sleep + Bad-el heal = passive sustain strategy
4. **Mithrala Lifebane** (Legendary Spirit, Undead Hordes) - Hex damage + buffs + +80 ACC aura

**Sample Doom Tower Hard Team (Sand Devil):**
- Bad-el-Kazar (heal + cleanse + Poison), Vogoth (tank + Sleep), Scyl (revive + stun), Godseeker Aniri (revive all), Tayrel (Dec DEF)

---

## Cheese Strategy Potential

**NO CHEESE STRATEGIES** - Bad-el-Kazar is a **solo carry champion**, not a cheese enabler.

**Why no cheese:**
- Bad-el's strength is **self-sufficiency** (AoE heal A1, cleanse + heal + Poison A2, passive damage boost)
- Does not enable duplicate-champion cheese (passive does NOT stack - multiple Bad-els = only 1 passive active, confirmed by Ayumilove 2020-02-17)
- Does not enable Ally Attack cheese (no Ally Attack skill)
- Does not enable unkillable cheese (no Block Damage or Unkillable)
- Does not enable MAX HP damage cheese (Poison = 5% MAX HP, not 25-30% burst like Coldheart/Royal Guard)

**Use Case:** Bad-el is a **solo farming specialist** - Carry 4 fodders in Dragon 25, Ice Golem 25, Nightmare Campaign for maximum energy efficiency (5x XP per run vs standard team)

## Investment Recommendations

### **Priority Level:** **CRITICAL** ⭐⭐⭐ (Top 5 champions to invest in)

**Why CRITICAL:**
1. **Solo farming capability** - Farm Dragon 25 + Ice Golem 25 with 4 fodders (energy efficiency GAME-CHANGING, 5x XP per run)
2. **Clan Boss UNM viability** - 9/10 rating, top-tier sustain + Poison (pairs with Geomancer, Skullcrusher, Frozen Banshee)
3. **Doom Tower Hard** - 9/10 rating, best sustain champion for long boss fights (cleanse + heal critical)
4. **Faction Wars** - 8/10 rating, carries Undead Hordes through Normal → Hard (core team member)
5. **Unique utility** - ONLY champion in roster with heal + cleanse + Poison combo (irreplaceable)

### **Booking Priority:**
- ✅ **USER'S STATUS: FULLY BOOKED** (All skills maxed)
- ⚠️ **REQUIRES 9 BOOKS TOTAL** (A1: 4 books, A2: 2 books, A3: 3 books - BUT A3 is passive, no books needed)
- **Book priority:** A2 first (reduce cooldown 5 → 3 turns), then A1 (damage + heal increase)
- **Stop after A2 maxed:** If limited books, prioritize A2 cooldown reduction (CRITICAL for Clan Boss/Doom Tower)

### **When to Stop Investment:**
- ✅ **6-star:** YES (required for solo farming + Clan Boss UNM survivability)
- ✅ **Full masteries:** YES (Warmaster required for Clan Boss damage) - **USER STATUS: Can unlock with 800 gems OR farm Minotaur, not yet selected**
- ✅ **Books:** YES (A2 fully booked = CRITICAL, A1 optional but recommended) - **USER STATUS: Fully booked**
- ⏳ **Gear:** Farm until 260+ SPD, 250+ ACC, 60k+ HP, 3.5k+ DEF (solo Dragon 25 threshold) - **USER STATUS: 262 SPD ✅, 263 ACC ✅, 72k HP ✅, 3.1k DEF ✅**

### **PVE Disclaimer:**
"This champion requires **full booking (A2 minimum) and 6-star ascension** for optimal performance in Clan Boss UNM and solo farming. Without A2 books, cooldown (5 turns) is too long for sustained cleanse/heal uptime. User's current build exceeds all thresholds for solo Dragon 25 + Clan Boss UNM."

## Optimization Recommendations (User-Specific)

### **IMMEDIATE ACTION (This Week):**

1. ✅ **Select Masteries** ⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
   - **Recommendation:** Use **PVE General build** (Offense + Support with Warmaster + Master Hexer)
   - **Why:** Warmaster required for Clan Boss damage, Master Hexer extends Poison +1 turn, Lasting Gifts extends Continuous Heal +1 turn
   - **Impact:** Unlocks Clan Boss UNM viability (currently missing Warmaster damage procs)

2. ✅ **Test Solo Dragon 25** ⭐ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - **Setup:** Bad-el-Kazar + 4 fodder champions (level 1-50 for XP farming)
   - **Expected clear time:** 5-8 minutes (slow but consistent)
   - **Expected success rate:** 95-100% (262 SPD + 72k HP + 3.1k DEF exceeds all thresholds)
   - **Impact:** 5x XP efficiency vs standard teams = GAME-CHANGING energy efficiency

### **SHORT-TERM (Next 2 Weeks):**

3. ⏳ **Increase Resist to 150+** ⭐ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (For Clan Boss UNM)
   - **Current:** 128 Resist
   - **Target:** 150+ for Clan Boss UNM, 180+ for Doom Tower Hard
   - **Gap:** +22 Resist (for UNM), +52 Resist (for DT Hard)

   **How to achieve +22 Resist:**
   - **Option A:** Banner with Resist main stat (if not already) = +60-100 Resist (instant fix)
   - **Option B:** Roll Resist substats on 2-3 pieces (+10-15 Resist per roll) = +20-45 Resist over 2 weeks
   - **Option C:** Swap 3-piece Protection set for Resistance set = +50 Resist (requires farming Void Keep Stage 20+)
   - **Recommended:** Option A (Banner swap) is fastest if current banner is Accuracy (you have 263 ACC, can afford to lose some)

   **Impact:** Prevents Dec DEF/Weaken debuffs from landing in Clan Boss (keeps survivability high, extends run duration from ~20 turns to ~30+ turns)

4. ⏳ **Test Clan Boss UNM** ⭐ **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (After masteries selected + Resist increased)
   - **Team:** Skullcrusher (Counterattack), Bad-el-Kazar (cleanse + heal + Poison), Geomancer (HP Burn), Frozen Banshee (Poison), Tayrel (Dec DEF)
   - **Expected damage:** 15-25M per key (with Warmaster + 150 Resist + full team)
   - **Speed tuning:** Bad-el-Kazar at 262 SPD may need adjustment (Counterattack teams typically 170-190 SPD range)

### **LONG-TERM (Future Optimization):**

5. ⏳ **Farm Reflex Set** (Fire Knight Stage 20+) ⭐ **LOW PRIORITY**
   - **Why:** Reflex reduces A2 cooldown (Malice every 1-2 turns instead of 3), community-validated (WarToad Feb 2025)
   - **Current gear:** Immortal + Perception works excellently for solo farming, no urgent need to swap
   - **When to farm:** After completing all other priorities (Clan Boss UNM optimized, Doom Tower Hard cleared, Faction Wars completed)

6. ⏳ **Farm Frenzy Set** (Doom Tower reward) ⭐ **LOW PRIORITY**
   - **Why:** Frenzy gains Turn Meter when hit (faster lapping of bosses for solo farming)
   - **Current gear:** 262 SPD already laps Dragon 25 (~150 SPD), Frenzy not essential
   - **When to farm:** Optional upgrade for faster solo clears (5-8 min → 3-5 min)
