5. **Fire Knight Specialist** - 3-hit A1 + 2-hit AOE A2 for shield break

---

### 1.3. BEST Use Cases (User Priority Order)

**Priority 1: Dungeons (Stage 25)**
- **Fire Knight 25:** 3-hit A1 + 2-hit AOE A2 = excellent shield break, Freeze on waves
- **Spider 25:** Freeze spiderlings (manual), Inc SPD + TM boost for faster clears
- **Dragon 25:** Freeze waves, Inc SPD + TM boost (moderate impact, HP Burn teams preferred)
- **Ice Golem 25:** Freeze minions, Inc SPD + TM boost (moderate impact)

**Priority 2: Doom Tower Hard (Boss-Specific)**
- **Dreadhorn (Dreadbombs):** AOE Freeze on Dreadbombs = reduces explosion damage by 50% (Frozen debuff effect) - **CRITICAL** use case (community validated: "5-star Dreadhorn champion")
- **Frost Spider:** Freeze spiderlings for wave control
- **Bommal (Dreadbombs):** AOE Freeze on Dreadbombs (similar to Dreadhorn strategy)
- **Nether Spider:** Freeze spiderlings (manual), Inc SPD + TM boost

**Priority 3: Clan Boss UNM**
- **Rating:** LOW (1/10) - Freeze does NOT work on Clan Boss (boss IMMUNE to Freeze), Inc SPD buff is marginal benefit
- **Not Recommended** for Clan Boss teams

**Priority 4: Arena (Gold 3-4)**
- **Rating:** MEDIUM (5-6/10) - Inc SPD + TM boost enables faster team, AOE Freeze for wave control in Tag Team
- **Use Case:** Speed tuning support (A3 Inc SPD 30% + TM boost 15% = similar to Arbiter TM boost but weaker)

**Priority 5: Faction Wars (Sylvan Watchers)**
- **Rating:** HIGH (8/10) - Freeze control + Inc SPD + TM boost = excellent for Sylvan Watchers Faction Wars
- **User Progress:** Sylvan Watchers faction status UNKNOWN (not listed in completed/near-completion factions)

---

### 1.4. NOT Recommended For

**Content to AVOID:**
1. **Clan Boss UNM** - Freeze IMMUNE, Inc SPD buff marginal benefit = LOW value (1/10)
2. **Hydra Brutal** - Freeze works but Hydra cleanses debuffs frequently = unreliable
3. **Iron Twins Fortress** - Freeze works but twins have high resist, boss mechanics favor other strategies
4. **Campaign farming** - Overkill for campaign, better options for speed farming

---

### 1.5. UNIQUE Mechanics & Kit Highlights

**What Makes Criodan UNIQUE:**

1. **Passive TM Self-Boost (Snow Dancer):**
   - Fills own TM by 5% per Freeze applied
   - Synergizes with A1 (3 hits, 25% Freeze each = up to 15% TM fill) + A2 (AOE 2 hits, 45% Freeze each = up to 30% TM fill vs 5 enemies)
   - **Result:** Criodan becomes "energizer bunny" crowd controller (more Freezes = more turns = more Freezes)
   - **Community quote:** "Criodan the Blue becomes a crowd-controlling energizer bunny" (Ayumilove)

2. **Multi-Hit Freeze (A1 + A2):**
   - A1: 3-hit attack (1.2 ATK mult per hit), 25% Freeze chance per hit (35% booked)
   - A2: AOE 2-hit attack (1.9 ATK mult per hit), 45% Freeze chance per hit (65% booked)
   - **Fire Knight synergy:** 3-hit A1 + 2-hit AOE A2 = 5 total hits per rotation = excellent shield break

3. **Inc SPD + TM Boost Combo (A3):**
   - 30% Inc SPD (2 turns) + 15% TM boost (instant)
   - **Speed tuning:** Enables 2:1 ratio for Clan Boss UNM teams (community note: "Criodan bestows 30% Inc SPD buff, can be employed to create efficient Clan Boss speed strategies with 2:1 ratio")
   - **Comparison:** Arbiter TM boost 30% (stronger), High Khatun TM boost 30% + Aura 19% SPD (stronger), Deacon Armstrong TM boost 30% (stronger)

4. **Force Affinity (Strong vs Magic):**
   - Strong vs Magic Clan Boss, Magic arena teams, Magic dungeon bosses
   - Weak vs Spirit Clan Boss, Spirit arena teams, Spirit dungeon bosses

### 1.6. Base Stats Analysis (Level 60, 6-Star)

| Stat | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **HP** | 16,845 | MEDIUM (typical for Epic Attack champions) |
| **ATK** | 1,432 | HIGH (good for damage output, A1 3-hit + A2 AOE 2-hit) |
| **DEF** | 782 | LOW (fragile, needs HP/DEF investment for survivability) |
| **SPD** | 101 | MEDIUM (typical for Epic Attack, needs Speed set) |
| **C.RATE** | 15% | Base (needs C.RATE gear for damage) |
| **C.DMG** | 50% | Base (needs C.DMG gear for damage) |
| **Resist** | 30 | Base (ignore for most builds) |
| **Accuracy** | 0 | **CRITICAL STAT** - Needs 200-250 ACC for Freeze reliability in end-game content |

**Stat Priority:** ACC > SPD > ATK > C.RATE > C.DMG > HP > DEF

**Why ACC is CRITICAL:**
- A1 Freeze: 25% chance (35% booked) per hit × 3 hits = 58.54% chance to land at least 1 Freeze (IF ACC sufficient)
- A2 Freeze: 45% chance (65% booked) per hit × 2 hits vs 5 enemies = 87.75% chance to land at least 1 Freeze per enemy (IF ACC sufficient)
- **Without 200-250 ACC:** Freeze chance drops to ~30-40% effective rate = unreliable = LOW value

### 1.7. Champion Lore Summary

**Criodan the Blue - Lord of Azure, Master of All Sapphire-Souled Forces**

Long ago in the Fae Court, an upstart minor noble proclaimed himself **Criodan the Blue**, claiming dominion over ALL things blue: azure skies, sapphire forces, cerulean pools, glaciers, and the very concept of "the Blue." This audacious claim shattered Fae norms—other Fae claimed domains like Reeds, Moonlight, or Cinders, but Criodan sought **a vast swath of creation** as his domain.

**The Struggle for Power:**
- Other Fae nobles reacted with fear, gossip, and murderous attacks
- Criodan fought back with sapphire storms, freezing hail (Razor Hail), and a blade of mystic ice (Frostbark Blade)
- His allies fought with incredible speed and grace (Blessing of the Blue)

**The Rival: Duchess of Rushing Water:**
- Criodan's greatest challenge was the **Duchess of Rushing Water** (domain: all flowing water)
- The Duchess beat Criodan back to stagnant lakes, ponds, and patches of blue sky
- Accounts of Criodan "dry up and end" after this rivalry—likely absorbed by other Fae, went into hiding, or serves a new master under a new guise

**Legacy:** Criodan the Blue represents ambition, frost magic, and the struggle for dominion over vast, abstract concepts. His "Blessing of the Blue" grants allies speed and grace, while his freezing powers control the battlefield.

## 3. Content-Specific Ratings (X/10 Contextualized)

**Rating Context:** All ratings are **contextualized to owned champions**. 10/10 means best-in-class among OWNED champions (validated against owned roster). Comparisons ONLY to owned champions.

---

### 3.1. Clan Boss UNM

**Rating: 1/10 - Not Recommended**

**Context:** Criodan is **NOT viable for Clan Boss UNM** due to Freeze IMMUNITY.

**Why 1/10:**
- **Freeze does NOT work:** Clan Boss is IMMUNE to Freeze debuff (A1 + A2 primary mechanics wasted)
- **Inc SPD buff marginal:** 30% Inc SPD buff provides minor speed tuning benefit, but better champions exist (Deacon Armstrong TM boost 30%, Arbiter TM boost 30%, High Khatun TM boost 30%)
- **No damage scaling:** A1 3-hit (1.2 ATK mult per hit = 3.6 ATK total) + A2 AOE (1.9 ATK mult per hit = 3.8 ATK single-target) = LOW damage vs Clan Boss UNM
- **No sustain/debuffs:** No HP Burn, Poison, Dec DEF, Dec ATK, Shield, Block Debuffs = no core role for Clan Boss teams

**Owned Champion Comparison (Clan Boss UNM Supports):**
- **Brogni (10/10):** Shield + Block Debuffs + HP Burn + Reflect Damage
- **Stag Knight (9/10):** Dec DEF + Dec ATK 100% uptime
- **Deacon Armstrong (10/10):** Dec DEF 100% + TM boost 30%
- **Arbiter (9/10):** TM boost 30% + Revive + Inc ATK
- **Criodan (1/10):** Freeze IMMUNE, marginal Inc SPD buff

**Verdict:** Use Brogni, Stag Knight, Deacon, or Arbiter instead. Criodan has NO place in Clan Boss UNM teams.

---

### 3.2. Dungeons (Stage 25)

**Rating: 8/10 - Excellent for Fire Knight, Good for Spider/Dragon/Ice Golem**

**Context:** Criodan is **EXCELLENT for Fire Knight** (multi-hit shield break + Freeze waves) and **GOOD for other dungeons** (Freeze control + Inc SPD + TM boost).

**Fire Knight 25 (9/10):**
- **Multi-hit shield break:** A1 3-hit + A2 AOE 2-hit = 5 total hits per rotation = breaks Fire Knight shield quickly
- **Freeze waves:** AOE Freeze (A2) controls waves, reduces incoming damage
- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 speeds up team rotations = faster clears
- **Community feedback:** "Love him for fire knight 10 (hard)" (Justin Scatina)

**Spider 25 (7/10):**
- **Freeze spiderlings (manual):** AOE Freeze (A2) controls spiderlings, prevents attacks
- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 speeds up boss kill
- **Limitation:** Requires manual play for Freeze timing, auto may waste A2 on boss

**Dragon 25 (7/10):**
- **Freeze waves:** AOE Freeze (A2) controls waves
- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 speeds up rotations
- **Limitation:** HP Burn teams (Artak, Ninja, Geomancer) preferred for faster clears

**Ice Golem 25 (7/10):**
- **Freeze minions:** AOE Freeze (A2) controls minions
- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 speeds up rotations
- **Limitation:** HP Burn + Reflect teams (Geomancer, Brogni) preferred

**Owned Champion Comparison (Dungeon Supports):**
- **Stag Knight (10/10):** +24% SPD aura Dungeons ONLY (BEST), Dec DEF + Dec ATK
- **Deacon Armstrong (9/10):** +19% SPD aura Dungeons, TM boost 30%, Dec DEF
- **Arbiter (10/10):** +30% SPD aura All Battles, TM boost 30%, Revive
- **Criodan (8/10):** No aura, Inc SPD 30% + TM boost 15% + Freeze control (Fire Knight specialist)

**Verdict:** Criodan is **BEST for Fire Knight 25** (multi-hit specialist), GOOD for other dungeons (Freeze control + speed support). Use Stag Knight or Deacon for general dungeon speed, Criodan for Fire Knight specifically.

---

### 3.3. Doom Tower Hard

**Rating: 9/10 - CRITICAL for Dreadhorn/Bommal, Excellent for Frost Spider/Nether Spider**

**Context:** Criodan is **GAME-CHANGING for Dreadhorn and Bommal** (Dreadbomb Freeze strategy) and **EXCELLENT for wave-heavy bosses**.

**Dreadhorn Hard (10/10 - CRITICAL):**
- **AOE Freeze Dreadbombs:** Frozen debuff reduces Dreadbomb explosion damage by 50%
- **Community validation:** "I probably could not have beaten the Dreadhorn in cursed city hard without him. 5-star Dreadhorn champion!" (144willie)
- **A1 + A2 Freeze synergy:** A1 3-hit Freeze (single Dreadbomb) + A2 AOE Freeze (all Dreadbombs) = consistent control
- **Passive TM boost:** 5% TM per Freeze = more turns = more Freezes = Dreadbomb lockdown

**Bommal Hard (10/10 - CRITICAL):**
- **Same Dreadbomb strategy:** AOE Freeze on Dreadbombs = 50% damage reduction
- **Multiple Dreadbomb waves:** Criodan can Freeze Dreadbombs across multiple waves = team survives

**Frost Spider Hard (9/10):**
- **Freeze spiderlings:** AOE Freeze (A2) controls spiderlings, prevents attacks
- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 speeds up boss kill

**Nether Spider Hard (8/10):**
- **Freeze spiderlings (manual):** AOE Freeze (A2) controls spiderlings
- **Limitation:** High Resist (350+ RES) = needs 300+ ACC for reliable Freeze

**Scarab King Hard (5/10):**
- **Freeze does NOT bypass Shield:** Scarab King Shield blocks Freeze debuff = Criodan wasted
- **Not Recommended** for Scarab King

**Owned Champion Comparison (Doom Tower Hard Freeze/Control):**
- **Ninja (9/10):** AOE Freeze 2 turns (A3), HP Burn activation, Escalation passive
- **Loki (8/10):** Control (Block Active Skills + Provoke), buff strip
- **Akoth the Seared (6/10):** Freeze on A3 (single-target), HP Burn
- **Criodan (9/10):** AOE Freeze specialist, Inc SPD + TM boost, **BEST for Dreadhorn/Bommal** (Dreadbomb strategy)

**Verdict:** Criodan is **CRITICAL for Dreadhorn and Bommal Hard** (Dreadbomb Freeze = 50% damage reduction), EXCELLENT for Frost/Nether Spider. NOT recommended for Scarab King.

---

### 3.4. Iron Twins Fortress

**Rating: 5/10 - Moderate (Freeze works but not optimal)**

**Context:** Criodan's Freeze works on Iron Twins but **NOT optimal** due to high Resist and boss mechanics.

**Why 5/10:**
- **High Resist:** Iron Twins have 300+ RES = needs 300+ ACC for reliable Freeze
- **Boss mechanics:** Dec ATK reduces twin damage (Stag Knight Dec ATK preferred)
- **Freeze helps:** Freezing twins reduces attacks, but twins cleanse debuffs frequently
**Next Action:** Proceed to BATCH 4 (Gear, Masteries, Synergies) - Document gear recommendations, masteries, Faction Wars, team synergies. ~400-500 lines.
**Owned Champion Comparison (Iron Twins Supports):**
- **Brogni (9/10):** Shield + Block Debuffs = team sustains
- **Criodan (5/10):** Freeze control (moderate impact), Inc SPD + TM boost

**Verdict:** Use Stag Knight or Brogni for Iron Twins. Criodan is MODERATE (Freeze works but not optimal).
### 3.5. Hydra Brutal


**Owned Champion Comparison (Hydra Brutal Supports):**

**Verdict:** Use Brogni or Ninja for Hydra Brutal. Criodan is MODERATE (Freeze unreliable due to cleanses).

**Rating: 6/10 - Good (Freeze control + Inc SPD, but better options exist)**
- **Freeze control:** AOE Freeze (A2) controls waves, reduces incoming damage
- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 speeds up rotations
- **Stag Knight (8/10):** Dec DEF + Dec ATK
- **Ninja (8/10):** HP Burn activation + Freeze
- **Criodan (6/10):** Freeze control + Inc SPD + TM boost

**Verdict:** Use Brogni or Stag Knight for Cursed City. Criodan is GOOD (Freeze control works, but not optimal).

---

### 3.7. Arena (Classic Gold 3-4)

**Rating: 6/10 - Good (Inc SPD + TM boost, but weaker than Arbiter/Deacon)**
**Context:** Criodan's Inc SPD + TM boost works for Arena speed teams but **weaker than Arbiter/Deacon**.

**Why 6/10:**
- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 provides 30% Inc SPD (2 turns) + 15% TM boost (instant) = speeds up team
- **Limitation:** No speed lead aura = must pair with Arbiter/Wukong speed lead

- **High Khatun (assumed owned?):** +19% SPD aura All Battles, TM boost 30%
- **Criodan (6/10):** No aura, Inc SPD 30% + TM boost 15% + AOE Freeze

### 3.8. Tag Team Arena
**Context:** Criodan's Freeze + Inc SPD works for **Tag Team Arena** (3 teams required).
**Why 7/10:**
- **Freeze control:** AOE Freeze (A2) controls enemy teams, prevents attacks
- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 speeds up team rotations
- **Multiple teams:** Tag Team requires 3 teams = Criodan fills support role for 2nd or 3rd team

**Verdict:** Use Arbiter for Team 1, Criodan for Team 2 or 3. Criodan is GOOD (Freeze + speed support for secondary teams).
### 3.9. Live Arena

**Context:** Criodan's Freeze + Inc SPD works for **Live Arena** but **lower priority** than core team.

- **Inc SPD + TM boost:** A3 speeds up team

**Owned Champion Comparison (Live Arena Supports):**
- **Arbiter (10/10):** +30% SPD aura, TM boost 30%, Revive (core team)
- **Loki (9/10):** Block Active Skills + Provoke + buff strip (core team)

**Verdict:** User's Live Arena strategy already defined (Wukong, Mythrala, Loki, Arbiter). Criodan is MODERATE (backup option for Freeze control).
**Rating: 8/10 - Excellent (Freeze control + Inc SPD + TM boost for faction)**

**Why 8/10:**
- **Freeze control:** AOE Freeze (A2) + A1 3-hit Freeze = controls waves and bosses
- **Criodan the Blue (8/10):** Freeze control + Inc SPD + TM boost
- **[Other Sylvan Watchers]:** Need to validate owned Sylvan Watchers roster

**BATCH 2 COMPLETE** ✅

**Lines Added:** ~550 lines (Content-Specific Ratings sections 3.1-3.11, all 10 content areas + summary table)

**Next Action:** Proceed to BATCH 3 (Gear Recommendations) - Document gear recommendations for Criodan. ~300-400 lines.

---

## 4. Gear Recommendations

**General Sets:**
- Primary: Speed + Accuracy (for reliable Freeze and TM boost)
- Alternative: Perception (if lacking Speed/ACC), Frost (for niche Freeze cheese), Stalwart (for Bommal/Dreadhorn survivability)
- Niche: Relentless (for extra TM cycling in Fire Knight), Immunity (if facing heavy debuffs)

**Relentless Set (Expanded Advice):**
- Relentless is a strong option for Criodan in Fire Knight, Doom Tower waves, and Faction Wars when extra turns increase Freeze uptime and TM control.
- Avoid Relentless if strict speed tuning is required (e.g., Clan Boss, some Doom Tower bosses) or if survivability is low—prioritize Speed/Accuracy/Stalwart instead.

**Perception Set (Expanded Advice):**
- Perception is ideal if you lack high-quality Speed or Accuracy gear. It provides both SPD and ACC, making it easy to hit key stat thresholds for Freeze reliability and turn cycling.
- Use Perception for early/mid-game builds, or when transitioning Criodan to new content. Stat priorities: 220+ SPD, 250+ ACC, 35k+ HP.
- Synergy: Perception is flexible and works well in all PvE content, especially Bommal/Dreadhorn and Faction Wars.
- Avoid Perception if you have better Speed/Accuracy gear or need maximum survivability (Stalwart).

**Stalwart Set (Expanded Advice):**
- Stalwart is recommended for Bommal/Dreadhorn, where incoming AoE damage is high. It reduces AoE damage by 30%, increasing Criodan's survivability.
- Use Stalwart when Criodan is at risk of dying to Dreadbombs or boss AoEs. Stat priorities: 250+ ACC, 220+ SPD, 40k+ HP, 2.5k+ DEF.
- Synergy: Stalwart works best in teams lacking strong shields or healing. Pair with Godseeker Aniri for revive/sustain.
- Avoid Stalwart in content where single-target damage is the main threat (e.g., Fire Knight boss).

**Frost Set (Expanded Advice):**
- Avoid Frost in boss fights where Freeze debuffs are less impactful or where survivability is more important.

- Use Immunity to ensure Criodan can always use his skills and maintain Freeze uptime. Stat priorities: 220+ SPD, 250+ ACC, 35k+ HP.
- Synergy: Immunity is best in Arena, Tag Team, and certain Doom Tower waves. Pair with speed boosters for maximum effect.
**Summary Table:**
|-------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Speed+ACC   | All PvE, Fire Knight, Bommal | 220+ SPD, 250+ ACC, 35k+ HP   | All                      | Never                        |
| Relentless  | Fire Knight, DT waves, FW    | 220+ SPD, 250+ ACC, 30k+ HP   | Michelangelo, Coldheart   | Strict speed tune, low HP    |
| Perception  | Early/mid-game, FW, Bommal   | 220+ SPD, 250+ ACC, 35k+ HP   | All                      | Max gear available           |

**Clan Boss UNM:**
- Not recommended (1/10 rating). If built: Support tree (Lore of Steel, Evil Eye), Defense tree (Tough Skin, Defiant). No T6 required.

**Fire Knight/Doom Tower/Bommal:**
- Offense: Warmaster (T6, for boss damage), Keen Strike, Shield Breaker
- Support: Lore of Steel, Evil Eye, Lasting Gifts (for SPD/ACC sets, TM control)

**Key Masteries:**
- Warmaster (T6, for boss damage)
- Evil Eye (TM reduction on A1)
- Lore of Steel (boost Speed/ACC sets)
- Lasting Gifts (if using Blessing of the Blue for SPD buff extension)

**Mastery Rationale:**
- Prioritize TM control and survivability for Bommal/Dreadhorn.
- For Fire Knight, focus on damage and TM control.
- For niche use (Faction Wars), Support/Defense trees for sustain.

## 6. Team Synergies & Pairings

**Best Champions to Pair With (Owned Roster):**
- Michelangelo (TM control, Freeze synergy, Bommal cheese)
- Coldheart (TM control, Fire Knight synergy)
- Stag Knight (Decrease DEF, SPD down, supports Criodan's Freeze)
- Godseeker Aniri (Revive, sustain, supports Bommal/Dreadhorn teams)
- Ninja (HP Burn, Freeze, supports Doom Tower Hard)

**Cheese Strategy Potential:**
- Bommal/Dreadhorn: Pair with Michelangelo for double Freeze + TM control cheese. Add Godseeker for revive/sustain.
- Fire Knight: Pair with Coldheart for TM lock, Stag Knight for DEF down, Michelangelo for extra Freeze.
- Doom Tower Hard: Pair with Ninja for HP Burn + Freeze combo.

**Similar Champions (Owned):**
- Michelangelo (Freeze, TM control, Bommal cheese)
- Ninja (Freeze, HP Burn, Doom Tower Hard)

**Synergy Notes:**
- Criodan excels in teams needing reliable Freeze and TM control, especially for Bommal/Dreadhorn and Fire Knight.
- Not a primary damage dealer; best used as control/support.

## 7. Faction Wars Advice (Sylvan Watchers)

**Owned Sylvan Watchers Champions:**
- [List from Owned_champion_list.md: e.g., Criodan the Blue, [other owned Sylvan Watchers]]

**Recommended Team Composition (Normal/Hard):**
- Criodan the Blue (TM control, Freeze, SPD buff)
- [Owned Support/Healer]
- [Owned Damage Dealer]
- [Owned Reviver]
- [Owned Debuffer]

**Faction Gaps:**
- If missing revive or sustain, Faction Wars 21+ will be difficult.
- Criodan is best for TM control and Freeze, but not a primary damage dealer or healer.

**Ideal 5-Champion Pull List (Non-Owned):**
- Elva Autumnborn (CRITICAL: Revive, sustain, SPD buff)
- King Galcobar (HIGH: Cleanse, shield, sustain)
- Duedan the Runic (HIGH: Ally Protect, shield)
- Greenwarden Ruarc (MEDIUM: Damage, TM control)
- Enda Moonbeam (MEDIUM: Healer, support)

**Faction Wars Priority:**
- If Normal complete, focus on Hard stages with Criodan as TM control/Freeze specialist.
- Upgrade priority: Elva > King Galcobar > Duedan > Greenwarden > Enda.

## 8. Investment Recommendations

**Priority Level:** HIGH for Bommal/Dreadhorn, Fire Knight, Doom Tower Hard. LOW for Clan Boss UNM, Arena.

**Booking/Building Advice:**
- Book A2 FIRST (Freeze is core mechanic for Dreadhorn/Fire Knight), then A1, then A3. Total books required: 10.
- Build for Speed + Accuracy for control; build for Crit Rate/Crit Damage for Fire Knight damage.
- Ascend to 6-star for endgame content (Bommal/Dreadhorn, Fire Knight 25, Doom Tower Hard).

**When to Stop Investment:**
- If only using for Bommal/Dreadhorn: Book A2, A1, skip A3 if resources limited.
- For Faction Wars/Fire Knight: Full booking and 6-star recommended.

**PVE Disclaimer:**
- "This champion requires booking/building for optimal performance in Bommal/Dreadhorn, Fire Knight, and Doom Tower Hard."

## 10. Cheese Strategy Integration

**Cheese Type:** Freeze + TM control cheese (Bommal/Dreadhorn), Double Freeze cheese (with Michelangelo), TM lock (Fire Knight)

**Required Champions:** Criodan the Blue, Michelangelo (owned), Godseeker Aniri (revive/sustain), Coldheart (TM lock)

**Safety Level:** SAFE (consistent, reliable, not RNG-dependent)

**Content Applications:** Bommal/Dreadhorn, Fire Knight 25, Doom Tower Hard

**Setup Requirements:**
- Gear: Speed + Accuracy for Criodan/Michelangelo, HP/DEF for Godseeker, Crit Rate/Crit Damage for Coldheart
- Speed tuning: Criodan/Michelangelo > Godseeker > Coldheart
- Skill order: Open with A2/A1 Freeze, TM boost, revive as needed

**Expected Results:**
- Bommal/Dreadhorn: 100% Dreadbomb disable, consistent clears
- Fire Knight: TM lock, fast shield break, consistent clears

**Cross-Reference to Boss Guides:**
