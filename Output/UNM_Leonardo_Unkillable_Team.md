## 1. Team Concept & Philosophy

**Core Mechanic:** Leonardo's A2 provides Unkillable (2 turns) + Counterattack + Ally Protection + Inc DEF. Godseeker Aniri extends all buffs +1 turn (2→3 turns), creating 75% Unkillable uptime in a 4-turn cycle.

**Why Leonardo > Tanky Killable:**
- **Damage Ceiling:** 70-95M vs 40-55M (75% increase)
- **Counterattack Multiplier:** Boss attacks trigger 4-hit Leonardo A1 + Michelangelo joins (6-8 hits per boss turn)
- **Turn 50 Limit:** Unkillable ignores damage until turn 50 (Gathering Fury pierces after)
- **Glass Cannon Builds:** Unkillable protection allows 100% C.RATE, 250%+ C.DMG focus (no survivability needed)

**Why NOT Leonardo (Current State):**
- ❌ Requires 7 Legendary books on Leonardo (A2 5→3 turn CD is MANDATORY)
- ❌ Requires full Epic books on Godseeker Aniri (A2 4→3 turn CD is MANDATORY)
- ❌ Requires Michelangelo regear (+25 SPD from 245→270)
- ❌ Requires Geomancer regear (+39 SPD from 224→263)
- ❌ Manual-dependent (Godseeker AI terrible, needs Mithrala swap for auto)
- ❌ Turn 50 hard limit (Tanky Killable can survive 60-80 turns with proper sustain)

**Verdict:** Build AFTER securing 1-key reliability with Tanky Killable team (72M+ goal achieved first).

## 2. Core vs Current Team Comparison

| Aspect | Tanky Killable (Current) | Leonardo Unkillable (Future) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Damage Range** | 40-55M baseline, 68M peak | 70-95M manual, 50-70M auto |
| **Speed Tune** | 3:2 (267-277 SPD) | 3:2 (263-280 SPD) |
| **Champions** | Aniri, Brogni, Stag, Mithrala, Geomancer | Leonardo, Godseeker, Mickey, Brogni, Geo |
| **Books Required** | Partial (Brogni only) | Full books on 3 Legendaries |
| **Turn Limit** | 60-80 turns (sustainable) | 50 turns (Unkillable expires) |
| **Auto Viable** | ✅ 90% success | ⚠️ 60% (needs Mithrala swap) |
| **Affinity Safe** | ✅ All Void/Spirit/Magic | ⚠️ Weak on Force boss (Leonardo Void) |
| **Build Difficulty** | Medium | High |
| **Resource Investment** | Low | Very High |

**When to Transition:**
1. ✅ Tanky Killable hitting 72M+ consistently (1-key secured)
2. ✅ Leonardo fully booked (7 Legendary books acquired)
3. ✅ Godseeker fully booked (Epic books)
4. ✅ Michelangelo & Geomancer regeared to 263-280 SPD
5. ✅ All champions have Warmaster/Giant Slayer completed

## 3. Leonardo Team Roster

### Manual Team (Max Damage)

| Champion | SPD | Role | Why Essential |
|----------|-----|------|---------------|
| **Leonardo** | 267 | Unkillable/Counterattack/Tank | A2: 3-turn Unkillable (with Godseeker) + 4-hit counterattacks |
| **Godseeker Aniri** | 277 | Buff Extension | A2: Extends Leonardo 2→3 turns (75% uptime) |
| **Michelangelo** | 270 | Join Attack DPS | Passive: Joins Leonardo attacks (doubles damage) |
| **Underpriest Brogni** | 274 | Block Debuffs/Shield | A3: Covers gap turn (4th turn) + shields |
| **Geomancer** | 263 | Weaken/HP Burn/Stun Target | A3: 1.25× damage amp + reflect damage |

**Expected Damage:** 70-95M (manual, optimal rotation)

---

### Auto Team (Reliability Focus)

| Champion | SPD | Role | Why Swap |
|----------|-----|------|----------|
| Leonardo | 267 | Unkillable/Counterattack/Tank | Same |
| **Mithrala** | 277 | Cleanse/Shield | Godseeker AI terrible, Mithrala auto-safe |
| Michelangelo | 270 | Join Attack DPS | Same |
| Brogni | 274 | Block Debuffs/Shield | Same |
| Geomancer | 263 | Weaken/HP Burn/Stun Target | Same |

**Expected Damage:** 50-70M (auto, 90% success rate)

**Trade-off:** Lose Godseeker buff extension (75%→50% Unkillable uptime), gain cleanse safety + auto reliability.

---

## 4. Speed Tune Requirements

**Speed Tune Type:** 3:2 (263-280 SPD, NO speed lead)

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This team requires **TRUE SPEED** 263-280 (without aura). Do NOT use speed lead champions (High Khatun, Arbiter, etc.) - wastes damage slot.

### Speed Tune Table

| Champion | Target SPD | Range | Turn Order | Current Status |
|----------|------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Godseeker Aniri** | 277 | 274-280 | 1st (fastest) | ✅ READY (currently 277) |
| **Underpriest Brogni** | 274 | 270-277 | 2nd | ✅ READY (currently 274) |
| **Michelangelo** | 270 | 267-274 | 3rd | ❌ NEEDS +25 SPD (currently 245) |
| **Leonardo** | 267 | 264-270 | 4th | ❌ NEEDS FULL BUILD |
| **Geomancer** | 263 | 263-266 | 5th (slowest - stun target) | ❌ NEEDS +39 SPD (currently 224) |

**Why Geomancer Slowest:** Stun target every 3 turns. Geomancer has high DEF + HP Burn reflect passive, best suited for absorbing stuns.

**Reference:** See `UNM_Clan_Boss_Team_Analysis.md` Section 3 for detailed 3:2 speed tune mechanics.

---

## 5. The 4-Turn Rotation

**Core Cycle:** Leonardo Unkillable active for 3 turns (with Godseeker extension), gap turn covered by Brogni Block Debuffs.

### Rotation Overview

**Boss Turns 1-3:** Leonardo Unkillable ACTIVE (3 turns with Godseeker extension)
- Leonardo counterattacks: 4 hits per boss turn (A1 2-hit, repeats on counterattack)
- Michelangelo joins: ~2-4 hits per boss turn
- Total: ~6-8 hits per boss turn × 3 turns = ~18-24 hits

**Boss Turn 4:** Leonardo Unkillable OFF (gap turn)
- Brogni Block Debuffs covers this turn
- Leonardo A2 refreshes (3-turn CD)
- Godseeker A2 ready to extend next cycle

**Cycle Repeats:** 50 boss turns = 12.5 cycles

---

### Critical Timing (4-Turn Pattern)

**Turn 1 (Rounds 1-2):**
- **Round 1:** Leonardo A2 (Unkillable!) → Brogni A3 (Block Debuffs) → Geo A3 (Weaken/HP Burn) → Others A1
- **Round 2:** Godseeker A2 (extend Unkillable 2→3 turns!) → All others A1

**Turns 2-3 (Rounds 3-6):**
- All A1 spam (Leonardo Unkillable still active)
- Counterattacks continue

**Turn 4 (Rounds 7-8): GAP TURN**
- **Round 7:** Leonardo A2 (refresh!) → Brogni A3 (Block Debuffs covers gap) → All others A1
- **Round 8:** Godseeker A2 (extend!) → All others A1

**Repeat for ~12-13 cycles**

---

### Buff Duration Breakdown

**With Godseeker Extension:**
- Leonardo Unkillable: 2 turns → **3 turns** (75% uptime)
- Brogni Block Debuffs: 2 turns (66.7% uptime on its own)
- **Combined:** 95%+ debuff protection (gap turn overlap)

**Without Godseeker (Mithrala variant):**
- Leonardo Unkillable: 2 turns (50% uptime)
- Brogni Block Debuffs: 2 turns (66.7% uptime)
- **Trade-off:** Lower damage, but cleanse recovers from Decrease Speed if debuffs land

## 7. Manual Rotation Guide

### Turn-by-Turn Execution (First 4 Boss Turns)

**BOSS TURN 1:**

**Champion Round 1:**
1. Leonardo: A2 (Unkillable + Counterattack + Ally Protection + Inc DEF!)
2. Brogni: A3 (Block Debuffs + Shield)
3. Geomancer: A3 (Weaken + HP Burn)
4. Michelangelo: A1
5. Godseeker: A1 or A3 (if needed)

**Boss attacks:** Leonardo counterattacks (4 hits), Michelangelo joins (~2-4 hits) = 6-8 hits

**Champion Round 2:**
1. Godseeker: **A2 (EXTEND UNKILLABLE 2→3 TURNS!)**
2. All others: A1

**Damage:** ~2.5-3M (counterattacks + HP Burn + Warmaster/GS procs)

---

**BOSS TURNS 2-3:**

**All champions:** A1 spam (Leonardo Unkillable still active 3 turns total)  
**Boss attacks:** Leonardo counterattacks (4 hits per turn), Michelangelo joins (~2-4 hits per turn)

**Damage per turn:** ~2.5-3M

---

**BOSS TURN 4: GAP TURN**

**Champion Round 7:**
1. Leonardo: **A2 (REFRESH UNKILLABLE!)**
2. Brogni: **A3 (BLOCK DEBUFFS - CRITICAL FOR GAP COVERAGE)**
3. All others: A1

**Champion Round 8:**
1. Godseeker: **A2 (EXTEND!)**
2. All others: A1

**Damage:** ~2.5-3M

---

**CYCLE REPEATS** for 50 boss turns (12.5 cycles)

---

### Critical Manual Timing

**DO:**
- ✅ Godseeker A2 on Rounds 2, 8, 14, 20... (immediately after Leonardo A2)
- ✅ Leonardo A2 on Rounds 1, 7, 13, 19... (every 4 rounds = 3-turn CD + 1 turn active)
- ✅ Brogni A3 on Rounds 1, 7, 13, 19... (gap turn coverage)
- ✅ Geomancer A3 on Round 1, then every 3 turns

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use Godseeker A2 before Leonardo A2 (wastes extension)
- ❌ Miss Brogni A3 on gap turn (Decrease Speed will break tune)
- ❌ Let Geomancer Weaken drop (damage loss)

---

## 8. Auto Mode: Mithrala Variant

### Why Swap Godseeker for Mithrala?

**Godseeker AI Issues:**
- ❌ Does NOT time A2 properly (extends at wrong turns)
- ❌ Unkillable only 50% uptime instead of 75%
- ❌ Run fails 20-30% of time (Decrease Speed lands during gap)

**Mithrala Auto Benefits:**
- ✅ A3 Cleanse recovers from Decrease Speed (speed tune safety)
- ✅ A3 Shield + Strengthen (additional survivability)
- ✅ AI uses skills correctly (auto-friendly)
- ❌ NO Buff Extension (Leonardo 2-turn Unkillable = 50% uptime)

---

### Auto Team Composition

| Champion | SPD | Role | Priority |
|----------|-----|------|----------|
| Leonardo | 267 | Unkillable/Tank | 5/5 |
| **Mithrala** | 277 | Cleanse/Shield | 4/5 |
| Michelangelo | 270 | Join Attack DPS | 5/5 |
| Brogni | 274 | Block Debuffs | 5/5 |
| Geomancer | 263 | Weaken/HP Burn/Stun | 4/5 |

**Expected Damage:** 50-70M (auto, 90-95% success rate)

**Trade-off:** -20-25M damage vs manual, but reliable auto farming

---

## 9. Build Timeline & Resource Requirements

### Phase 1: Book Farming (Months 1-3)

**Priority:**
1. ✅ **Leonardo:** 7 Legendary books (A2 5→3 CD is MANDATORY)
2. ✅ **Godseeker Aniri:** Full Epic books (already complete)
3. ⚠️ **Michelangelo:** Full Legendary books (recommended for A2 CD + Passive)
4. ⚠️ **Geomancer:** Full Legendary books (recommended for A3 CD)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 months (monthly events, tournaments, CB chests)

---

### Phase 2: Regearing (Weeks 1-2)

**Priority:**
1. **Michelangelo:** +25 SPD (245→270) - Speed boots + Speed set + SPD substats
2. **Geomancer:** +39 SPD (224→263) - Speed boots + Speed set + SPD substats
3. **Leonardo:** Full build (267 SPD, 3,500 DEF, 100% C.RATE)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks (gear farming + Great Hall bonuses)

---

### Phase 3: Mastery Completion (Weeks 1-2)

**Priority:**
1. **Leonardo:** Warmaster (DEF scaling)
2. **Michelangelo:** Giant Slayer (A1 2-hit)
3. **Geomancer:** Giant Slayer (A1 2-hit)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks (Minotaur farming)

---

### Total Timeline: 3-4 Months

**Milestones:**
- **Month 1-2:** Farm Leonardo books (7 Legendary)
- **Month 2-3:** Farm Michelangelo + Geomancer books
- **Month 3:** Regear all champions to 263-280 SPD
- **Month 4:** Mastery completion + testing

**Resource Cost:**
- **Books:** 7 Legendary (Leonardo) + 12-15 Legendary (Mickey/Geo) = ~20-22 Legendary books total
- **Energy:** ~5,000-10,000 for gear farming + masteries
- **Silver:** ~50-100M for gear upgrades

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Leonardo Unkillable Only 2 Turns

**Symptoms:** Unkillable shows 2 turns instead of 3

**Fixes:**
1. ✅ Godseeker A2 in Round 2, 8, 14... (immediately after Leonardo A2)
2. ✅ Verify Godseeker books (A2 MUST be 3-turn CD)
3. ✅ If auto: Use Mithrala variant instead

---

### Problem 2: Speed Tune Breaking

**Symptoms:** Boss laps team after ~10 turns

**Fixes:**
1. ✅ Verify ALL champions 263-280 SPD (check in battle, not lobby)
2. ✅ Remove ANY speed lead champions (aura breaks tune calculation)
3. ✅ Check for Decrease Speed debuff (cleanse immediately with Mithrala A3 or reset)

---

### Problem 3: Low Damage (30-40M instead of 70M+)

**Fixes:**
1. ✅ Verify Geomancer ACC 250+ (Weaken MUST land)
2. ✅ Verify 100% C.RATE on Leonardo, Michelangelo, Geomancer
3. ✅ Check affinity (avoid Force boss - Leonardo Void = weak)
4. ✅ Verify Leonardo books (A2 MUST be 3-turn CD for proper rotation)

---

### Problem 4: Team Dies During Gap Turn

**Symptoms:** Champions die on Turn 4, 8, 12...

**Fixes:**
1. ✅ Brogni A3 MUST be cast on Rounds 1, 7, 13, 19... (gap turn coverage)
2. ✅ Verify Brogni books (A3 MUST be 3-turn CD)
3. ✅ Increase Leonardo DEF to 4,000+ (takes Ally Protection damage)
4. ✅ Increase Brogni HP to 70,000+ (shield scaling compensation)

---

### Problem 5: Run Ends at Turn 50

**Symptoms:** Team wipes suddenly at turn 50

**This is EXPECTED:** Boss Gathering Fury ignores Unkillable/Block Damage after turn 50.

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Accept 50-turn limit (this is the cheese trade-off)
- ✅ Maximize damage in first 50 turns (optimize builds, rotation)
- ✅ If need longer runs: Use Tanky Killable team (60-80 turn survivability)

---
