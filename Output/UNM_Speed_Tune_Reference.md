## 1:1 Speed Tune (Beginner)

### Speed Range
- **171-189 SPD** (all champions)

### Turn Ratio
- 1 turn for every 1 boss turn

### Pros
- ✅ Easiest gear requirements (lowest SPD needed)
- ✅ Most forgiving (5-10 SPD variance tolerated)
- ✅ Best for early/mid-game players
- ✅ Works with low base SPD champions

### Cons
- ❌ Lowest skill rotation frequency
- ❌ Lowest debuff uptime
- ❌ Lowest damage output (40-60M typical)

### Recommended Use
Early UNM progression, survivability focus

## 3:2 Speed Tune (RECOMMENDED)

### Speed Range
- **Conservative**: 267-277 SPD
- **Aggressive**: 263-280 SPD

### Turn Ratio
- 3 turns for every 2 boss turns (1.5x boss speed)

### Math
- Boss speed post-Turn 1: 190 SPD
- Your team: 190 × 1.5 = 285 SPD (ideal)
- Safe range accounting for tick variance: **267-277 SPD**

### Pros
- ✅ **BEST balance** of damage vs gear requirements
- ✅ 50% more skill casts than 1:1
- ✅ High debuff uptime (Dec ATK, Inc DEF maintained)
- ✅ Moderate gear difficulty (achievable with good substats)
- ✅ Damage range: **70-120M**

### Cons
- ❌ Narrow speed window (±5 SPD tolerance)
- ❌ Requires SPD boots + Speed sets on most champions
- ❌ Decrease SPD debuff can break tune (need Block Debuffs or cleanse)

### Gear Requirements
**For 267 SPD target (100 base SPD champion):**
- SPD boots: +40 SPD
- Speed set (4pc): +12 SPD (12% of 100 base)
- **Substats needed**: 267 - 100 - 40 - 12 = **115 SPD**
- **Per piece** (6 gear pieces): 115 ÷ 6 = **~19-20 SPD per piece**

**Verdict**: Achievable with **good (not god-tier) gear**

### Recommended Use
**BEST for most players** - highest return on investment

## 2:1 Speed Tune (Endgame)

### Speed Range
- **Conservative**: 341-361 SPD
- **Aggressive**: 331-371 SPD

### Turn Ratio
- 2 turns for every 1 boss turn (2x boss speed)

### Math
- Boss speed post-Turn 1: 190 SPD
- Your team: 190 × 2 = 380 SPD (ideal)
- Safe range: **341-361 SPD**

### Pros
- ✅ **HIGHEST damage potential** (140-180M)
- ✅ Double skill casts = maximum debuff uptime
- ✅ Best for endgame/whale accounts
- ✅ Can hit debuff cap (10) solo without support

### Cons
- ❌ **EXTREMELY DIFFICULT** gear requirements
- ❌ Requires SPD boots + Speed set + Feral/Perception + god substats
- ❌ Base SPD 105+ champions only (95 base SPD = nearly impossible)
- ❌ Narrow speed window (±10 SPD tolerance at 340+ is brutal)
- ❌ Decrease SPD breaks tune instantly (MUST have Block Debuffs)

### Gear Requirements
**For 341 SPD target (100 base SPD champion):**
- SPD boots: +40 SPD
- Speed set (4pc): +12 SPD
- **Substats needed**: 341 - 100 - 40 - 12 = **189 SPD**
- **Per piece** (6 gear pieces): 189 ÷ 6 = **~31-32 SPD per piece**

**Verdict**: Requires **god-tier gear** (6+ SPD per roll, 5+ rolls per piece)

### Example Team
Deacon (leader), Aniri, Fayne, Venomage, Frozen Banshee (all 341-361 SPD)

### Recommended Use
Endgame only - requires exceptional gear (20+ SPD per piece)

## 4:3 Speed Tune (Counterattack)

### Speed Range
- **191-199 SPD** (all champions)

### Turn Ratio
- 4 turns for every 3 boss turns (1.33x speed)
- **PLUS Counterattack** = effective 2:1 turn ratio

### Special Requirement
**REQUIRES Counterattack champion:**
- Skullcrusher (Epic, Void)
- Valkyrie (Legendary, Spirit)
- Martyr (Legendary, Void)
- Cardiel (Legendary, Void)

### How It Works
- Boss speed post-Turn 1: 190 SPD
- Your team: 191-199 SPD
- Counterattack buff = extra team turn when boss attacks
- **Result**: 4 scheduled turns + counterattacks = ~6-8 total turns per 3 boss turns

### Pros
- ✅ Much easier SPD than 2:1 (191 vs 341)
- ✅ High damage (100-140M with Skullcrusher)
- ✅ Counterattack procs = 2x Warmaster procs
- ✅ Forgiving speed window (191-199 SPD = 8 SPD tolerance)

### Cons
- ❌ **REQUIRES specific champion** (Skullcrusher, Valkyrie, etc.)
- ❌ Skullcrusher needs 14 Legendary books (expensive)
- ❌ AI issues (Counterattack must be timed properly)
- ❌ Decrease SPD still risky

### Example Team
Skullcrusher, Brogni, Rhazin, Narma, Frozen Banshee (all 191 SPD)

### Recommended Use
If you own Skullcrusher or Valkyrie - very strong option

## Unkillable Speed Tunes (Pain Keeper / Maneater)

### Speed Range
**Varies by composition** (typically 191-254 SPD for different champions)

### Special Mechanic
Unkillable buffs from Pain Keeper / Maneater on specific turn cycles

### Common Unkillable Tunes

**Slow Budget Unkillable:**
- Pain Keeper: 241 SPD

- DPS champions: 191-193 SPD

**Fast Budget Unkillable:**
- Pain Keeper: 254 SPD
- Maneater: 228 SPD
- DPS champions: 191-193 SPD

**Myth-Heir (Heiress + Maneater):**
- Complex multi-speed tune (requires calculator)

### Pros
- ✅ Unkillable = never die (can survive 100+ turns)
- ✅ Damage: 80-150M (depending on DPS champions)
- ✅ Safe all affinities
- ✅ Glass cannon builds (no DEF/HP needed)

### Cons
- ❌ **REQUIRES Pain Keeper AND Maneater** (specific champions)
- ❌ Complex speed tuning (calculator mandatory)
- ❌ Locks 2 team slots (only 3 DPS champions)
- ❌ AI-dependent (auto mode can break)

### Recommended Use
If you own Pain Keeper + Maneater - top-tier option

## Common Speed Tune Issues

### Problem: Decrease SPD Debuff Breaking Tune

**Happens when:**
- Spirit Clan Boss applies Decrease SPD (-30% SPD for 2 turns)
- Targets slowest champion on your team

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Block Debuffs** (Brogni, Mausoleum Mage, Rector Drath)
2. ✅ **Cleanse** (Aniri, Godseeker, Scyl)
3. ✅ **High Resistance** (250+ RES to resist debuff)
4. ✅ **Slowest champion is stun target** (Geo, Brogni with high HP/DEF)

### Problem: Speed Tune Drifting Over Time

**Happens when:**
- Small speed differences accumulate over 30-50 turns
- Champions slightly out of range (266 vs 267)

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Use **DeadwoodJedi Speed Tune Calculator** (exact SPD targets)
2. ✅ Stay in **middle of speed range** (270 SPD for 267-277 range)
3. ✅ Test for **5+ runs** to confirm stability

### Problem: Can't Hit Speed Targets

**Happens when:**
- Low base SPD champions (95-100)
- Poor substat rolls on gear
- Using 2-piece sets instead of 4-piece Speed

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Use **high base SPD champions** (105-110 base SPD)
2. ✅ Farm **Speed sets** from Dragon 25
3. ✅ Use **Perception/Feral sets** (SPD + ACC in one set)
4. ✅ Prioritize **SPD substats** over offensive stats
5. ✅ Use **SPD aura leader** (Deacon, Arbiter)
