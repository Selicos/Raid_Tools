# Champion Log Generation Prompt

Let's run through the modules for Artak, and generate a log json file for review.

Please output the full champion log in JSON format, including:
- Modules 0–13 from the Champion Review and Comparison\Modules folder. 
- Overview, skills, synergy, mastery simulation, ratings, and final summary
- Format for easy copy-paste into champions/Artak.json

Use the structure and content of each file named `Champion_Review_Module_0.md` through `Champion_Review_Module_13.md` in `Champion Review and Comparison/modules/`.  
Do not use inline templates or external descriptions.
